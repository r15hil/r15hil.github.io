<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the chopped potatoes to one side of a tin foil-lined baking tray with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for an initial 15-20 min or until the potatoes are starting to brown</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Whilst the potatoes are cooking, wash your leek[s] thoroughly to remove any grit from between the leaves

Top, tail and slice finely

Combine in a bowl your mayo, Dijon mustard and white wine vinegar with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a generous pinch of salt and pepper – this is your mustard mayo dressing</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle

Remove the potatoes from the oven and add your smoked basa to the other side of the tray with a drizzle of olive oil and a generous grind of black pepper

Return the tray to the oven for a further 8-10 min or until the potatoes are golden and crisp and the fish is cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Whilst the fish is cooking, add your egg[s] to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt (salt prevents the eggs from cracking) and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cook for exactly 8 min for perfect, mid-boiled eggs, then fill a bowl of very cold water and add the boiled egg[s] to the bowl and set aside

Once cooled, peel the egg and cut into quarters</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced leek with a small pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until softened and slightly caramelised</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the fish is cooked, remove the tray from the oven and break the cooked smoked basa up into large, rough pieces on the tray

Wash your salad, then pat them dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Add the roasted potatoes and smoked basa to a plate and sprinkle over the caramelised leek and salad

Top with the boiled egg quarters and drizzle over the mustard mayo dressing

Season with a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
