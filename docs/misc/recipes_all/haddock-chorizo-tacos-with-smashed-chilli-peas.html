<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle

Cut your red chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely

Roll your lime[s] with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice!) and cut in half</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add your blanched peas to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt, bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 2-3 min or until they're tender

Once cooked, drain and return to the pot to steam dry</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Whilst the peas are cooking, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Combine your natural yoghurt, chopped garlic (not a big garlic fan? Try using less!) and the juice of half your lime[s] in a small bowl – this is your tangy garlic yoghurt

Cut the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Return the cooked peas to a low heat with a large knob of butter

Once melted, add the chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Mash until you're left with a coarse pea mash – these are your smashed chilli peas</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your diced chorizo and cook for 4-5 min or until crisped</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add your tortillas to a plate and pop in the microwave for 20 secs on high or until warmed through

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add your haddock bites (unevenly sized haddock bites? Chop any larger ones into bite-sized pieces!) to the pan with the chorizo and cook for 5 min further, turning once halfway, until the fish is cooked through – this is your haddock & chorizo

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Top the warmed tortillas with some tangy garlic yoghurt, haddock & chorizo, smashed chilli peas and salad

Garnish with a lime wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
