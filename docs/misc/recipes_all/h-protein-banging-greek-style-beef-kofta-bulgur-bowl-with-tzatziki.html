<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle

Add your minced beef to a large bowl with your panko breadcrumbs

Add half your Mediterranean seasoning and half your roasted garlic paste (you’ll use the rest later!) with a very generous pinch of salt and pepper, then give everything a good mix up until thoroughly combined (clean hands is the best way!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Divide and shape into koftas (3 per person!) – these are your beef koftas</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a matching lid over a high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the beef koftas and cook for 2 min on each side or until browned

Reduce the heat to medium-high, cover with a lid and cook for a further 6-7 min, turning occasionally, then remove the lid and cook for 2-3 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!) – these are your Greek-style beef koftas

Tip: Cooking for 4 or more? You may need to use 2 pans</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Whilst the koftas are cooking, add your bulgur wheat to a pot with plenty of boiled water

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 7-9 min or until tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain and return to the pot</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, chop your cucumber[s] into rough, bite-sized pieces

Chop your tomato[es] into thin wedges

Wash your lettuce then pat it dry with kitchen paper and roughly shred</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add your chicken stock mix to the cooked bulgur with the remaining roasted garlic paste and Mediterranean seasoning

Add a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your garlicky bulgur</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Greek-style beef koftas over the garlicky bulgur with the lettuce, tomato wedges and remaining chopped cucumber to the side

Top the salad with your cider vinegar, a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Serve with a dollop of chunky tzatziki to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
