<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 180°C/ 160°C (fan)/ gas 6

Deseed the peppers (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

Add the pepper strips to a baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt

Put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min until roasted and golden – these are your roasted peppers</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once cooked, remove the roasted peppers from the oven

Stir half of the roasted peppers into the risotto (save the rest for garnish!)

Remove the risotto from the heat and stir in half of the grated cheddar flavour block and half of the chopped chives, then season with a grind of black pepper – this is your sweet mixed pepper & chive risotto</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To serve, top the sweet mixed pepper & chive risotto with the reserved roasted peppers, remaining grated cheddar flavour block and the pine nut & seed mix

Garnish with the reserved chopped chives and a drizzle of olive oil

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
