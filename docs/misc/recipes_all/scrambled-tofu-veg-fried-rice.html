<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Deseed your pepper[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>(scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and roughly dice

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once hot, drain your tofu, pat dry with kitchen paper and crumble it with your fingers directly into the pan

Add your ground turmeric and a generous pinch of salt to the tofu and cook, stirring frequently, for 3-4 min or until starting to crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, heat a separate large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the diced pepper with your ginger & garlic paste and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant

Wash your spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, add your cooked white long grain rice to the pan with the diced pepper, then add your Chinese rice wine, half your soy sauce (save the rest for later!) and the spinach

Cook for 3-4 min or until the spinach has wilted and the rice has warmed through – this is your veg fried rice</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>While the spinach is wilting and the rice is warming through, trim, then slice your spring onion[s] roughly</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the tofu is crisp, add the remaining soy sauce and agave and cook for 1 min further or until the soy sauce has been absorbed – this is your scrambled tofu

Mix half the scrambled tofu and half the sliced spring onion through the veg fried rice (you'll use the rest for garnish!)</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the remaining scrambled tofu over the veg fried rice

Garnish with the remaining sliced spring onion

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
