<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-14 min or until the rice and chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

Tip: Stir halfway through, to stop it sticking!

Once cooked, put the lid back on and set aside, for 4-5 min – this is your one pot peri peri chicken & rice</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the rice is ready, drain your sweetcorn

Add the drained sweetcorn to a bowl with a knob of butter and a pinch of salt and pepper

Put the bowl in the microwave for 1-2 min or until the butter has melted and the corn is warmed through – this is your buttered corn</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Top the one pot peri peri chicken & rice with the buttered corn and drizzle over your natural yoghurt

Season with a grind of pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
