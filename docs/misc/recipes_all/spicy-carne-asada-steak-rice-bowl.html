Tip: Keep the seeds in if you like it spicy!

Combine the juice of the orange<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>with the juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lime, chopped green chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), ground cumin and soy sauce and give everything a good mix up – this is your carne asada marinade</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Whilst the rice is cooking, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once very hot, add the marinated steaks (save the extra marinade for later!) to the pan

For rare, cook for 2 min max on each side

For medium-rare, cook for 2-3 min on each side

For medium, cook for 3-4 min on each side</p><br><br>

<p>Cut the avocado<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in half lengthways, around the stone<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Remove the stone<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> using a teaspoon

Scoop the avocado out of the skin<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> using a spoon and slice it finely, lengthways and season with a pinch of salt

Chop the coriander finely, including the stalks</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the steaks are done, transfer them to a plate and set them aside to rest

Return the pan to a medium heat, add the remaining marinade and cook for 2-3 min or until thickened slightly – this is your carne asada sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Slice the rested steaks finely – this is your carne asada steak</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Cut the remaining lime into wedges

Serve the carne asada steak over the cooked rice and drizzle with the carne asada sauce

Top with the pickled red cabbage, sliced avocado, crumble over the feta cheese and garnish with the chopped coriander and a wedge of lime
