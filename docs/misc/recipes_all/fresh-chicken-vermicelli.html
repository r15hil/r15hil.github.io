<h3>Instructions</h3>
<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Submerge the noodles in cold water in a wide pot


Soak in the water for 5-8 min (off of the heat), or until loosened and softened


Set the pot over a medium heat for 5-8, until warmed and tender


Drain and rinse completely and set aside for step 7</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Zest and juice the lime<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> straight into a processor (reserve the lime skins for step 4)


Peel and roughly chop the ginger (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon)


Chop the chilli&nbsp;roughly, discarding the stalk


Chop the coriander roughly, including the stalks</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Place the chicken thighs in a pan (with a lid), cover with 150ml <span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> boiling water


Add the reserved lime skins from step 2


Add a big pinch of salt, and a lid


Cook on a low-medium heat for 15 min or until the chicken is cooked through and tender</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add the ginger, chilli, fish sauce, honey, coriander, peanuts, sesame oil <br />and soy sauce to the processor


Blitz to a rough paste- this is your fresh chutney</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Peel and top and tail the carrot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>


Continue to peel lengths off of the carrot, until you end up with a pile of carrot 'ribbons'


Peel as far as you can, then grate the inner stem


Slice the spring onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> finely&nbsp;</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Combine the cooked noodles in a large bowl with the carrot, spring onion and half the coriander chutney


Mix well (use your hands here!)</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Remove the lid from the chicken pan


Transfer the cooked chicken to a clean board, leaving the liquid behind


Slice the chicken thinly (with a knife and fork)


Return the chicken juice pan to a medium high heat and reduce by half 


Add the chicken back to the pan, and stir in the remaining chutney</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Add the sliced chicken and coriander juices to the noodles and mix well


Plate the noodles and chicken into bowls
