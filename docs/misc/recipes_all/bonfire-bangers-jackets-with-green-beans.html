<h4>Step 5</h4>

Return the tray to the oven for a final 10-12 min or until the sausages are cooked through and the sauce is sticky – these are your bonfire bangers

Dissolve the beef stock mix in 200ml [350ml] boiled water with the tomato ketchup – this is your beefy tomato stock</p><br><br>

Return the pan to a medium heat with a knob of butter and once melted, add  1 tsp<span class="text-danger"> [2 tsp]</span> flour and cook for 1 min until a sandy paste forms

Add the beefy tomato stock then whisk until combined and cook for 3-4 min or until thickened to a gravy-like consistency – this is your beefy tomato gravy</p><br><br>
