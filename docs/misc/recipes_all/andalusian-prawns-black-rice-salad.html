<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle

Rinse your brown rice and add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat.

Once boiling reduce the heat to medium and cook for 20-25 min or until it's tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain and set aside</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>

Chop your cherry tomatoes in half

Cut your lemon[s] in half

Chop your parsley finely, including the stalks, separating the stalks from the leaves</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Squeeze 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> lemon juice into a large mixing bowl

Combine with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and season with a pinch of salt and pepper then set aside – this is your lemon dressing

Wash your salad and pat dry with kitchen paper, then chop it roughly

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [4 tbsp] </span>olive oil over a medium-low heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once hot, carefully add the sliced garlic and cook until very slightly golden then remove with a slotted spoon and set aside on some kitchen paper – these are your garlic crisps

Sprinkle your garlic crisps with a pinch of salt and set aside until serving, keeping the pan and garlic oil for later</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Wait until your brown rice has already been cooking for 20 min before proceeding with this step

Return the pan of garlic oil to a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chopped cherry tomatoes and parsley stalks with a generous pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until they're beginning to break down</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Drain your jumbo prawns, then add them to the pan with your cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and cook for 5-6 min or until the prawns are cooked through

Add 50ml <span class="text-purple">[75ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[100ml]</span> water and cook for 1-2 min further until the tomatoes and garlic oil form a thick sauce

Once thickened, stir through the remaining chopped parsley and remove from the heat – these are your Andalusian-style jumbo prawns</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Toss your chopped salad and brown rice together in the bowl of lemon dressing – this is your brown rice salad

Cut the remaining lemon[s] into 1 wedge per person</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve your Andalusian-style jumbo prawns and sauce over your brown rice salad

Serve with a lemon wedge and garnish with the garlic crisps

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
