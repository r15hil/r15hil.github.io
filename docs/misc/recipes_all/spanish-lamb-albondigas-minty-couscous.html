<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the grill to a medium-high heat


Cut the yellow pepper<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in half (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon)


Add the yellow pepper<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> to a baking tray, skin-side up, and place them directly under the grill for 8-10 min or until the pepper<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> has blackened slightly (charring adds a smoky flavour!)


Once cooked, set aside to cool slightly</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, combine the lamb&nbsp;mince with the panko breadcrumbs, smoked paprika and a generous pinch of salt and pepper


Mix thoroughly (clean hands are best!), then divide the mixture into 8 <span class="text-danger">[16]</span> pieces


Shape into meatballs</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat with a drizzle of olive oil


Once hot, add the meatballs and cook for 2-3 min on each side or until browned&nbsp;


Tip:&nbsp;over-crowding the pan can make the meatballs sweat, so cook them in batches if needed


Once browned, transfer the&nbsp;meatballs&nbsp;to a plate and keep the pan for later</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Return the pan to a medium-low heat

<h4>Step 6</h4>

Stir in the tomato paste, chopped tomatoes and chicken stock and cook for 6-7 min or until the sauce has thickened and the meatballs are cooked through - these are your Lamb Albondigas


Re-boil a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, dissolve the remaining&nbsp;chicken stock cube in 200ml <span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> boiled water


Add the couscous and sultanas to a heat-proof bowl with the chicken stock, cover and set aside for 5-10 min or until all the stock has been absorbed


Strip the mint leaves from their stalks and chop finely


&nbsp;</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Once cooked, fluff the couscous with a fork, then add half of the chopped mint and&nbsp;a knob of butter and mix through


Serve the Lamb Albondigas over the minty couscous and garnish with the remaining chopped mint


Enjoy!</p><br><br>
