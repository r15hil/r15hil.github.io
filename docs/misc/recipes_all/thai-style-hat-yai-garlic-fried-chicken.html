<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Take your chicken out of the fridge and open the packet to let it breathe before cooking

Peel and chop (or grate) the garlic as finely as you can

Chop most of the coriander finely, including the stalks (save some for garnish!)

Combine the chopped coriander, garlic, soy sauce in a large bowl with 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your Hat Yai marinade</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Remove 1 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp] </span>from the Hat Yai marinade and transfer it to a separate medium bowl (you'll use this for your salad dressing later!)

Cut the chicken thighs in half and add them to the large bowl of Hat Yai marinade, give everything a good stir and set aside to marinate</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Rinse, then add the white long grain rice and 225ml <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked 

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add the cornflour to the Hat Yai chicken and give everything a good mix up until the chicken is nicely coated

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to cover the whole base of the pan) over a medium-high heat

Once the pan is very hot, add the coated chicken and cook for 5-6 min on each side until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and crispy – this is your Thai-style Hat Yai garlic fried chicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Whilst the chicken is cooking, deseed the red pepper<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

Peel the carrot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>, then continue to peel lengths until you end up with a pile of carrot ribbons

Wash and shred the gem lettuce finely, then pat it dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Combine the sriracha and chilli jam in a bowl – this is your sweet chilli sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the rice vinegar and 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil to the medium bowl of the reserved Hat Yai marinade

Add the pepper strips, carrot ribbons and shredded gem lettuce and give everything a good mix up – this is your Thai salad</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Thai-style Hat Yai garlic fried chicken with the cooked rice, Thai salad and sweet chilli sauce to the side

Sprinkle over the crispy onions and remaining coriander leaves

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
