<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Put a large baking tray (or two) in the oven to heat up (this will stop the pizza bottoms from going soggy!)

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

Peel and finely slice your red onion[s]</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Top with the pepper strips, sliced red onion, drained sweetcorn and torn mozzarella

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 13-15 min or until the cheese has melted and the bases are crisp – these are your bbq veggie loaded pizzas

Tip: Make sure the pizzas don’t overlap on the tray to avoid raw dough!</p><br><br>
