<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil half a kettle

Trim the green stalk[s] off your aubergine[s] and chop into bite-sized pieces

Peel and chop your red onion[s] into wedges

Heat a large, wide-based hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a generous drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once hot, add the chopped aubergine and onion wedges to the dish with your butternut squash cubes

Add your baharat, tomato paste, roasted garlic paste and a very generous pinch of salt

Stir it all together and cook for 1 min or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Give everything a good mix up and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cover with a lid and put the dish in the oven for an initial 30-35 min or until the sauce has thickened and the aubergine has softened – this is your oven-baked spiced aubergine tagine</p><br><br>
