<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion and chopped sweet potato with a pinch of salt and cook, covered, for 6-8 min or until beginning to brown

Meanwhile, boil a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Combine your lamb mince with the chopped garlic, your ras el hanout and a generous pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up (clean hands is the best way!) in a large bowl – this is your spiced lamb mixture</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add the spiced lamb mixture to the pan and cook for 5 min or until beginning to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

Tip: Keep the pan covered when not stirring as this will help the sweet potato to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Dissolve your chicken stock mix in 250ml <span class="text-purple">[375ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> boiled water

Once the lamb mixture has started to brown, add the chicken stock to the pan and stir to combine

Reduce the heat to medium and cook, covered, for a further 5 min or until the lamb is cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

Add your diced apricots to the pan and cook for a further 1-2 min – this is your Moroccan-style lamb & sweet potato tagine

Fluff the softened couscous with a fork</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Moroccan-style lamb & sweet potato tagine with the couscous to the side

Garnish with the chopped coriander

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
