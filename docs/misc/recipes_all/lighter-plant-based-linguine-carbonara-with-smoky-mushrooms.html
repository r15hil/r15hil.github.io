<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Finely slice your flat white and chestnut mushrooms

Add the sliced mushrooms to a baking tray (or two!) with 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1 tbsp] </span>vegetable oil, your ground smoked paprika, soy sauce and a pinch of salt

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 15-20 min or until tender and crisp – these are your smoky mushrooms</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Boil a full kettle

Peel and finely dice your shallot[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add your linguine to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the linguine for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite then drain, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the pasta is cooking, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the diced shallot with a pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min or until starting to soften

Once starting to soften, add the chopped garlic and cook for 1 min further or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the garlic is fragrant, reduce the heat to medium-low and add your creamy single soy to the pan with your miso and half your cider vinegar (save the rest for later!)

Tip: The miso adds an umami flavour to the sauce!

Season with a generous grind of black pepper and cook for 2-3 min or until thickened to a double cream-like consistency</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, trim the end[s] from your courgette[s] keeping the stalk[s] intact

Without cutting through the stalk[s], carefully slice the trimmed courgette[s] into thin strips, lengthways (at approx. 0.5cm intervals)

Peel lengths of the sliced courgette[s] until you have a pile of ‘courgetti’

Tip: Have a spiraliser? Use this instead!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the sauce has thickened, add the cooked linguine and courgetti to the pan with half of the smoky mushrooms (save the rest for later!) and give everything a good mix up until the pasta is fully coated in the sauce – this is your plant-based linguine carbonara

Tip: Add a splash of starchy cooking water if the sauce is a little thick!

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Combine the remaining cider vinegar with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil in a bowl and give it a good mix up – this is your dressing

Serve the plant-based linguine carbonara and top with the remaining smoky mushrooms and a grind of black pepper

Serve the salad to the side and drizzle over the dressing

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
