<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you start cooking, take your steak out of the fridge, open the packet and let it adjust to room temperature

Preheat the oven to 140°C/ 120°C (fan)/ gas 1

Add your shredded kale to a large baking tray (or two!) with a pinch of salt, 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tsp]</span> sugar and a drizzle of vegetable oil, give everything a good mix up, then put the tray[s] in the oven for 25-30 min or until crispy – this is your crispy ‘seaweed’</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, transfer the cooked rice to a plate and spread it out flat to help it cool down, reserve the pot</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the rice is cooking, peel and grate your garlic

Peel and cut your brown onion[s] into quarters, then separate the wedges so you end up with a pile of onion petals

Slice your red chilli[es] finely

Pat your rump steak[s] dry with kitchen paper, then slice into strips and add to a large bowl with the grated garlic, half your soy sauce (you’ll use the rest later!), cornflour and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>flour and mix it all together – this is your coated steak</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) to high heat with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the coated steak to the pan and cook for 3-4 min on each side or until golden and crisp

Once crisp, transfer to a clean plate and set aside, reserving the pan – this is your crispy steak</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pan to a medium heat

Once hot, add the onion petals and sliced chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, return the reserved pot to the heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, crack your egg[s] into the pot and stir with a wooden spoon to break the yolk[s] and cook for 1-2 min until it resembles scrambled egg

Once scrambled, add the cooled rice and half the remaining soy sauce (save the rest for later!), mix it all together and cook for 2-3 min or until everything is combined and warmed through – this is your egg fried rice</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Combine your red chilli relish, tomato ketchup, rice vinegar, remaining soy sauce and 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> cold water in a small bowl – this is your chilli sauce

Once the vegetables have softened, add the crispy steak and chilli sauce to the pan and stir it all together

Cook for a further 2-3 min or until the sauce has thickened – this is your crispy chilli steak</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the crispy chilli steak with the egg fried rice and crispy 'seaweed' to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
