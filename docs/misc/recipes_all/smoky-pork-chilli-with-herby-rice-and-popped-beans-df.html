<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 240°C /220°C (fan) / gas 9 and boil a kettle

Rinse the brown rice, add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 15-20 min or until it's tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain, return it to the pot and keep covered until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the rice is cooking, peel and finely dice the red onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a low heat

Once hot, add the diced red onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 10 min or until slightly softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the onion softens, drain and rinse the red kidney beans, reserving the liquid

Add half of the drained kidney beans to a baking tray (you'll use the rest later!)

Drizzle them with olive oil and season with a pinch of salt and pepper

Put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until the skins have burst and are crispy – these are your popped beans</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>While the chilli is cooking, trim, then slice the spring onions finely
