<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6 and take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Put a large baking tray (or two!) in the oven to heat up (this will stop the pizza bottom from going soggy!)

Cut your pepper[s] in half (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon), then chop into small bite-sized pieces

Peel and finely slice your shallot[s]</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Slice your green chilli[es] finely

Grate your cheddar cheese</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the diced chicken thigh with your ground smoked paprika, ground cumin and a pinch of salt and cook for an initial 5-6 min

Once done, add the chopped pepper and sliced shallot and cook for 5-6 min further or until the chicken is golden, crispy and cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your spicy chicken & pepper mixture</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>

Add 5 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[7 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[10 tbsp]</span> cold water and stir it all together – this is your tomato sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Remove the heated tray[s] from the oven and add your pizza base[s]

Spread the tomato sauce evenly between the pizza base[s] with the back of a spoon

Top with the spicy chicken & pepper mixture</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Sprinkle the pizza[s] with the grated cheese then top with the sliced green chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 13-15 min or until the cheese has melted and the base is crisp – this is your chicken thigh fajita pizza</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>While the pizza is cooking, combine your chipotle paste (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) with your mayo and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> cold water in a bowl – this is your chipotle mayo</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
