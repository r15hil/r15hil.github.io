<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ Gas 7

Slice the potatoes (skins on) into thick discs

Cut the red onions into wedges through the root, keeping the skin on

Tip: Cutting through the root ensures that they stay together while cooking</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the red onion wedges and potato discs to one side of a large baking tray

Drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and pepper

Add the meat-free sausages to a sheet of tin foil, scrunching up the edges, and place on the other side (alternatively, use separate trays)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Put the tray in the oven for an initial 20 min, or until the onions are tender

Meanwhile, combine the honey and wholegrain mustard in a small mixing bowl – this is your honey mustard mixture

Strip the rosemary leaves from the stems, discard of the stems and chop finely

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>

Once the onions are cool enough to handle, remove the skins

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid), with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> butter over a medium-high heat

Once melted, add the chopped rosemary and garlic and the sliced spring greens with a pinch of salt and cook for 2 min

Add a splash of cold water and cook, covered, for a final 1-2 min or until tender but retaining a slight crunch, then remove from the heat – these are your garlicky greens</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the golden potato discs, garlicky greens and onion petals all tumbled together

Top with the sticky meat-free sausages

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
