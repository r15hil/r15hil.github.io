<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a knob of butter over a medium heat

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add the white long grain rice, vegetable stock, a pinch of salt and pepper and the juice of half your lime[s] to the pan, then give everything a good mix up and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked, then remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving

Tip: Stir the rice occasionally to stop it from sticking!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Whilst the rice is cooking, pat your hake fillet[s] dry with kitchen paper and cut into bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped hake to a bowl with your cornflour, ground turmeric and a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up until the fish is evenly coated

Cut the remaining lime into 2 wedges per person</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the rice has had 10 min, heat a separate large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the coated hake to the pan and cook for 3-4 min on each side or until crispy and cooked through – this is your crispy hake

Tip: Your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>While the fish is cooking, wash your shredded spring greens, then pat them dry with kitchen paper

Add the shredded spring greens to the pan with the rice and cook, covered, for a further 2-3 min or until tender with a slight bite – this is your Lebanese-style spiced rice

Cut the remaining lime into wedges

Mix the juice of half the lime wedge[es] in a bowl with your tahini, a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt – this is your tahini sauce</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Lebanese-style spiced rice topped with the crispy hake and drizzle the tahini sauce all over

Garnish with your crispy onions and a remaining lime wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
