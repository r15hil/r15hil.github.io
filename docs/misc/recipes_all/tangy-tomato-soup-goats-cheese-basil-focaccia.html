<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Chop your cherry tomatoes in half

Cut your red onion[s] into wedges, leaving the skin on (this helps them cook quicker)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the halved cherry tomatoes, onion wedges and garlic (skins on) to a baking tray (or two!)

Add your dried oregano with a large drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 5 min or until the tomatoes are beginning to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, roughly tear your basil, including the stalks

Add the torn basil and a pinch of salt to a pestle & mortar and bash for 1-2 min or until it looks like a purée (alternatively, pulse in a food processor)

Add 3 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[4 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[6 tbsp]</span> olive oil and half your balsamic vinegar (you'll use the rest later!) then stir to combine – this is your balsamic basil purée</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Boil half a kettle

Remove the tray[s] from the oven and drizzle the remaining balsamic vinegar over the tomatoes

Return the tray[s] to the oven for a further 10-12 min or until the tomatoes are beginning to caramelise</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[260ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[380ml]</span> boiled water in a pot and add your chopped tomatoes – this is your tomato stock

Once the tomatoes have caramelised, remove the tray[s] from the oven and carefully cut the roots from the onion wedges

Carefully remove the skins from the onion and garlic and discard (beware, they will be hot!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add the roasted vegetables to the pot with the tomato stock

Add 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and cook over a medium heat for 4-5 min

Meanwhile, slice your ciabatta[s] in half and add to a baking tray, cut side up

Put the tray in the oven for 4-5 min or until they're hot and crusty</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Remove the pot from the heat and roughly blitz everything up with a (stick) blender, leaving some chunks for texture – this is your tangy tomato soup

Season with a grind of black pepper

Remove the warmed ciabatta halves from the oven</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Spread your goats' cheese over the warmed ciabatta halves and drizzle over half the balsamic basil purée

Serve the tangy tomato soup with the goats' cheese & basil ciabatta to the side

Drizzle the remaining balsamic basil purée over the soup

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
