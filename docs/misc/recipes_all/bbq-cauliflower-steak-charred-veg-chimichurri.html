<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut 2 <span class="text-danger">[4] </span>thick steaks from the centre of the cauliflower<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>(keep any leftovers, chop them into florets, then roast for a tasty snack!)

Add the cauliflower steaks to a baking tray, then drizzle the tamari soy sauce all over and put the tray in the oven for 30-35 min or until golden and tender, turning once halfway</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the potatoes have had 15 min, remove the tray from the oven and add the chopped pepper and halved spring onions with a drizzle of olive oil

Grind to a course paste, then add 2 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [4 tbsp]</span> olive oil with the red wine vinegar, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and the chopped shallot

Season with a pinch of salt and give everything a good stir – this is your chimichurri</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the cauliflower steaks are almost done, sprinkle the pumpkin seeds over the tray and return it to the oven for 2-3 min or until lightly toasted

Wash the rocket, then pat it dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the cauliflower steaks with the rocket, charred veg and crispy potatoes to the side

Drizzle the chimichurri all over the steaks, garnish with the toasted pumpkin seeds and serve with a dollop of garlic mayo and enjoy!
