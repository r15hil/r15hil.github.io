<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you start cooking, take your steak out of the fridge, open the packet and let them adjust to room temperature

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thick strips

Top, tail and slice your courgette[s] lengthways into 2 thick strips per person</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the sliced pepper and courgette strips to a baking tray (or two!) lined with tin foil

Add a drizzle of olive oil and a generous pinch of salt and pepper and put the tray[s] in the oven for 30 min or until the pepper and courgette are tender and charred</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, cut your potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized cubes

Add the cubed potatoes to a separate baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Put the tray in the oven for 25 min or until crispy and golden – these are your crispy potatoes</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat

Pat the rump steak[s] dry with kitchen paper, drizzle with vegetable oil and season with a pinch of salt and pepper on both sides

Once very hot, add the seasoned steak[s] to the pan

For rare, cook for 2 min max on each side; for medium-rare, cook for 2-3 min on each side; for medium, cook for 3-4 min on each side</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the steak is cooked, transfer to a clean board to rest, reserving the pan

Return the reserved pan to a medium-low heat

Once hot, crack your egg[s] into the pan, then cover with a lid and cook for 2-3 min or until done to your liking

Tip: Give your egg[s] a little shake before you crack for perfectly centred yolks!</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Slice the rested steak and wash your rocket, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Add the crispy potatoes and roasted veg to a plate with the sliced steak to the side

Top with the rocket and a fried egg and drizzle the chimichurri all over

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
