<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle


Grate the mature&nbsp;cheddar&nbsp;finely


Add a handful of flour to a plate

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Place your hand flat on the&nbsp;chicken breast<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>


Slice in half as if you were cutting a burger bun, so you are left with two thinner pieces of&nbsp;chicken


Coat the chicken in the flour, tap off the excess, then add it into the beaten egg and finally press it firmly into the cheesy&nbsp;breadcrumbs&nbsp;to evenly coat all over


Refrigerate until step 5&nbsp;</p><br><br>

Cook the linguine for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite


Once done, drain the linguine

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, re-boil a kettle<br /><br />Peel and finely slice the garlic&nbsp;


Roll the lemon<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice!) and cut in half


Cut half the lemon into wedges and reserve for garnish


Dissolve the chicken stock cube<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in 100ml <span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> boiled water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of&nbsp;vegetable oil&nbsp;over a medium-high heat


Once hot, add the&nbsp;breaded chicken&nbsp;and cook for 4-5 min on each side or until golden and cooked through


Tip: add more oil if your pan is looking a little dry&nbsp;


Once cooked, transfer the breaded chicken to kitchen paper (keep the pan!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Return the pan to a medium heat with a large knob of butter


Once hot, add the sliced garlic and cook for 1-2 min or until starting to lightly brown&nbsp;


&nbsp;</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once lightly browned, add the capers, clotted cream and chicken stock and cook for 1-2 min&nbsp;


Wash the baby&nbsp;spinach, then add it to the pan&nbsp;and cook for 2 min further or until the spinach is wilted&nbsp;


Squeeze in&nbsp;the juice of 1/2&nbsp;<span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lemon and season with a generous grind of black pepper


Add the drained linguine to the pan and give everything a good mix up</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Slice the breaded chicken&nbsp;


Serve the linguine,&nbsp;top with the sliced chicken and garnish with a wedge of lemon


Enjoy!</p><br><br>
