<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Combine your egg[s], most of your cornflour (save a little for later!) and 35g<span class="text-purple"> [45g]</span> <span class="text-danger">[60g]</span> flour in a jug, then gradually whisk in 75ml <span class="text-purple">[100ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[130ml]</span> milk and 25ml <span class="text-purple">[30ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[40ml]</span> cold water – this is your batter

Put the batter in the fridge to rest</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add your sausages to an oven-proof dish with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil

Put the dish in the oven for 12-15 min or until the sausages are beginning to brown</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Whilst the sausages are browning, top, tail, peel and chop your carrot[s] into batons and trim your green beans

Add the carrot batons and green beans to a large piece of tin foil (or two!) with a splash of cold water, a drizzle of olive oil and a grind of black pepper

Scrunch the foil around the veg to form a tightly sealed parcel[s] and add to a baking tray</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the sausages have browned, carefully pour the rested batter into the dish

Return the dish to the oven along with the veg parcel[s] and cook for 22-25 min, or until the batter is golden, the sausages are cooked through (no pink meat!) and the veg is tender – this is your toad in the hole and steamed veg

Tip: Don't peek! Opening the oven might make your giant Yorkie collapse!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, boil a kettle

Peel your potatoes and chop them into large, bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot with plenty of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once done, drain and return to the pot to steam dry

Return the potatoes to a low heat with a knob of butter and a splash of milk

Season with a grind of black pepper and mash until smooth</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Combine the remaining cornflour and beef stock mix in a jug with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[3 tsp]</span> flour

Gradually add 120ml <span class="text-purple">[180ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[240ml] </span>cold water and stir in your onion marmalade – this is your gravy mix

Put the gravy mix in the microwave for 2 min or until thickened, stirring halfway – this is your onion gravy</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the toad in the hole with the mash and steamed veg to the side

Drizzle the onion gravy all over the mash

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
