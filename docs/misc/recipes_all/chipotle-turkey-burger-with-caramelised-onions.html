<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut the potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until the chips are golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the chips are cooking, peel and finely slice the red onions

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced onions with a pinch of salt and sugar

Reduce the heat to very low and cook the onions, stirring frequently, until ready to serve or until they have softened and caramelised</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, season the turkey mince with a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Massage the meat with clean hands for 1 min (this helps them to hold their shape whilst cooking)

Divide the mince into 2 <span class="text-danger">[4]</span>, shape them into patties and refrigerate until later</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Slice the brioche buns in half

Heat a separate, large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat and add the brioche halves, cut-side down, and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted

Reserve the pan</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Combine the mayo with the chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) in a small bowl and season with salt and pepper – this is your chipotle mayo</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Wash the gem lettuce<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> and pat dry with kitchen paper

Remove 2<span class="text-danger">[4]</span> whole outer leaves and set aside for serving and tear the remaining leaves into bite-sized pieces

Add the torn leaves to a bowl and mix with a drizzle of olive oil and season lightly with salt and pepper – this is your crisp lettuce salad</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pan to a medium heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the chilled patties and cook them for 3-4 min on each side or until they're cooked through

Tip: Keep pressing the patties down with a spatula to keep them flat</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To assemble, top each toasted brioche base with a reserved lettuce leaf, a generous dollop of chipotle mayo, a cooked patty, caramelised onions and a toasted brioche lid – this is your chipotle turkey burger with caramelised onions

Serve any remaining chipotle mayo with the chips and crisp lettuce salad to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
