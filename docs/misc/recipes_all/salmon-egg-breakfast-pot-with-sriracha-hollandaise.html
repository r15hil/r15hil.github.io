<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Rise and shine! Before you begin…

Skim through these steps and get all your equipment ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Once done, simply dig in or wrap up ready for your day!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let’s get started!

Boil a kettle

Add your egg[s] to a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat (salt prevents the eggs from cracking)

Once boiling, cook for exactly 6 min for perfect, soft-boiled eggs, then fill a bowl of very cold water and add the cooked egg[s] to the bowl and set aside</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Wash your spinach and pat dry with kitchen paper

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the spinach with a pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min or until starting to wilt</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add a generous knob of butter to a heatproof bowl and put in the microwave for 20 secs or until melted

Once melted, add your mayo and sriracha (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the bowl with a squeeze of lemon juice and a pinch of salt and pepper

Stir it all together until you have a thick sauce – this is your sriracha hollandaise</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the spinach has started to wilt, push it to one side of the pan and add your salmon flakes to the other side

Cover with a lid and cook for 2-3 min or until warmed through</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Slice your ciabatta[s] in half and place in the toaster for 1-2 min or until toasted

Once toasted, spread with a knob of butter and cut in half diagonally – this is your toasted ciabatta[s]

Peel the cooled egg[s]</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Cut the remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person

To build your breakfast pot, serve the salmon flakes in a bowl with the wilted spinach, egg[s] and a lemon wedge to the side

Top the egg[s] with the sriracha hollandaise and season with a grind of black pepper – this is your salmon & egg breakfast pot with sriracha hollandaise</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve your salmon & egg breakfast pot with sriracha hollandaise with the toasted ciabatta slices to the side or box up to enjoy on-the-go

Time to start your day!</p><br><br>
