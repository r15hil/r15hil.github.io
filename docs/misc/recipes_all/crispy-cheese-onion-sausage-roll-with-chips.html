<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Peel and slice the red onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> finely

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 8-10 min or until softened and starting to caramelise</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, chop the potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray in the oven for 30 min or until golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Dust your work surface with a generous sprinkling of flour

Unwrap the puff pastry and roll it out to approx. 0.5cm thickness with a rolling pin, then cut into 2 <span class="text-danger">[4]</span> rectangles and add them to a baking tray lined with non-stick baking paper

Squeeze the sausage meat out of the sausage skins and into the centre of the pastry rectangles, lengthways

Tip: You should have 1.5 sausages per pastry rectangle

Press the sausage meat down a little with your fingers to flatten it slightly</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Grate the cheddar cheese

Top the sausage meat evenly with the caramelised onion (save the pan!)

Brush a little cold water around the edges of the pastry

Fold the pastry over the mixture and press it together with your fingers to seal in the sausage & onion with as little air trapped inside as possible

Crimp the seal edges with a fork – these are your sausage rolls</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Top the sausage rolls with the grated cheese and sprinkle over the nigella seeds

Put the tray in the oven for 15-20 min or until the sausage is cooked through and the pastry is puffed up and golden</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, boil half a kettle

Heat a medium pot with a knob of butter over a medium heat

Once melted, add 1/2 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [1 tbsp]</span> flour and cook for 30 secs

Add the chicken stock mix and 200ml <span class="text-danger">[350ml]</span> boiled water and cook for 8-10 min or until thickened – this is your gravy</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, rip the leaves off the spring greens, discard the tough stalks, then layer the leaves over each other, roll them up and slice into thin strips

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Return the reserved pan to a medium heat with a knob of butter

Add the spring greens and chopped garlic and cook for 3-4 min or until tender with a bite</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the crispy cheese & onion sausage roll with the chips and garlicky greens to the side

Pour the gravy all over

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
