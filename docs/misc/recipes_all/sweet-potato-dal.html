<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the lentils are cooked and most of the water has evaporated, toss in the drained spinach on a low heat


Gently fold the spinach through until wilted but holding its shape - this is your dal


Tip: This will thicken your dal, so thin it with a couple splashes of tap water


Season the onion with salt to taste</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Season the onion to your taste with salt


Serve the dal in bowls, topped with the sweet potato wedges and crispy onions


Sprinkle over the coriander and enjoy!</p><br><br>
