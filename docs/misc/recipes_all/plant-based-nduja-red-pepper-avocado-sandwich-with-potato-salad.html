<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the grill to high and boil a kettle

Chop your potatoes into large, bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 10-12 min or until fork-tender, then drain and return to the pot to steam dry</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the potatoes are cooking, peel and finely dice your shallot[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Cut your pepper[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>in half (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon)

Cut your avocado[s] in half lengthways, around the stone[s]

Remove the stone[s] using a spoon, then scoop out the avocado flesh and slice finely</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add the halved pepper (hollow side of the pepper facing up) to a tin foil-lined baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil

Put the tray under the grill for an initial 7-8 min or until the pepper is beginning to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the pepper is softening, add the diced shallot and chopped garlic (not a big garlic fan? Try using less!) to a bowl with your white wine vinegar, dried oregano and a pinch of salt and sugar

Add your mayo to the bowl and stir it all together – this is your quick-pickled shallot mayo</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the pepper has softened, remove the tray from the grill

Top the pepper halves with the plant-based 'Nduja (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and cheese flavour slices

Return the tray to the grill for a final 2-3 min or until the pepper is cooked through and the cheeze has melted</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, slice your ciabattas in half and place in the toaster for 1-2 min or until toasted

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To build your sandwich, top the toasted ciabatta base with the sliced avocado, grilled pepper, a handful of salad and a toasted lid

Serve the quick-pickled potato salad and remaining salad to the side

Drizzle a little olive oil over the salad

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
