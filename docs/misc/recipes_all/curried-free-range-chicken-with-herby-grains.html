<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Rinse your brown rice, then add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 20-25 min or until it's tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain and return it to the pot</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Whilst the rice is cooking, add your curry powder to a plate with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Give it a good mix up until it forms a paste

Add the free range chicken breast portion[s] to the plate and turn until fully coated in the spice paste – this is your coated chicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Peel your red onion[s], finely slice half, then chop the remaining red onion into wedges

Add the coated chicken to a tin foil-lined baking tray (or two!) with the onion wedges (you'll use the sliced onion later!)

Add a small drizzle of olive oil to the onion wedges and put the tray[s] in the oven for 18-20 min or until cooked through and golden (no pink meat!) – this is your curried free range chicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Whilst the chicken is cooking, add the sliced red onion to a bowl with your cider vinegar, a pinch of salt and 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]<span class="text-danger"> </span>[4 tbsp] </span>cold water

Set aside to pickle – this is your quick-pickled onion</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Cut your red chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely

Chop your cherry tomatoes in half</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Combine your natural yoghurt with your ground turmeric, a pinch of salt and a little of the pickling liquid from the onion in a separate bowl – this is your turmeric yoghurt dressing

Drain and rinse your green lentils, then wash your spinach and pat it dry with kitchen paper

Drain the quick-pickled onion and discard the liquid

Add the drained lentils and spinach to the pot with the cooked rice</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add your sultanas and diced apricots to the rice with a very generous pinch of salt

Stir it all together and cook over a medium heat for 2-3 min or until everything is warmed through and most of the spinach has wilted

Remove the pot from the heat and add the chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) with the chopped tomatoes and half the quick-pickled onion – these are your mixed grains

Slice the curried free range chicken finely on a clean board</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the sliced curried free range chicken and roast onion wedges over the mixed grains

Drizzle the turmeric yoghurt dressing all over and garnish with the remaining quick-pickled onion

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
