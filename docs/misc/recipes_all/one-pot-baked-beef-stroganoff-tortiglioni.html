<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min<span class="text-danger"> </span>to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Peel your brown onion[s] and chop into quarters</p><br><br>

<p>Add your diced beef and onion quarters to the dish and cook for 2-3 min or until the beef is very slightly browned all over</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>While the beef is browning, roughly crumble in your chestnut mushrooms, then add your tomato paste, red wine vinegar and most of your ground smoked paprika (save a pinch for garnish!) with the crushed garlic

Sprinkle in your beef stock mix with your soy sauce, Dijon mustard and 450ml <span class="text-purple">[585ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [765ml]</span> boiled water and give everything a good mix up

Bring to the boil over a high heat and season with a pinch of salt and pepper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once boiling, cover with the lid and put the dish in the oven for 35 min or until the beef is slightly tender

Reboil the kettle

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the beef has had 35 min in the oven, stir in your tortiglioni with 200ml <span class="text-purple">[275ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[350ml]</span> boiled water, cover with a lid and return the dish to the oven for an initial 15 min

After the 15 min, give everything a good mix up, then return the dish to the oven, covered, for a final 10 min or until the pasta is tender with a slight bite

Once done, remove the dish from the oven and stir through most of your soured cream (save some for garnish!) – this is your one-pot baked beef stroganoff tortiglioni</p><br><br>

<p>To serve, dollop the reserved soured cream over the one-pot baked beef stroganoff tortiglioni and sprinkle over the remaining ground smoked paprika

Season with a grind of pepper
