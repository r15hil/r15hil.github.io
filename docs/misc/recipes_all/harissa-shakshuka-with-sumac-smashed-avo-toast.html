<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Peel and cut your red onion[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>into quarters, then separate the wedges so you end up with a pile of onion petals

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and dice finely</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the onion petals and diced pepper

Cook for 5-6 min or until softened and starting to char</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the onion has softened, add your harissa paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) with the chopped garlic and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the juice of the orange[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>with your chopped tomatoes

Add 100ml <span class="text-purple">[130ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [175ml]</span> boiled water with your vegetable stock mix and bring to a boil, then once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 10 min or until the sauce has thickened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Wash your spinach, then pat dry with kitchen paper

Cut your avocado[s] in half lengthways, around the stone[s]

Remove the stone[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>using a spoon, then scoop out the avocado flesh and finely dice

Add the diced avocado to a small bowl with half your ground sumac (you'll use the rest later!), a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper and mash until a little chunky – this is your smashed avo</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the sauce has thickened, add the spinach and give everything a good mix up until it has wilted

Once the spinach has wilted, make 1 well per person in the pan and crack your egg[s] into them, then cook, covered for 2-3 min or until the egg[s] is done to your liking – this is your harissa shakshuka

Tip: Give your egg a little shake before you crack for perfectly centred yolk!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, slice your ciabatta[s] in half and place in the toaster for 1-2 min or until toasted

Once toasted, top with the smashed avo and cut into triangles – this is your sumac smashed avo toast</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the harissa shakshuka with the sumac smashed avo toast to the side

Sprinkle the remaining ground sumac over everything and season the egg[s] with a small pinch of salt and pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
