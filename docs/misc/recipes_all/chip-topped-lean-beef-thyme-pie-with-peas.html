Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 20 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>

Once hot, add the diced onion and carrot with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the onion and carrot have softened, add your lean beef mince to the pan and increase the heat to high

Cook for 4-5 min or until browned all over, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

Add the chopped garlic with the tomato stock and bring to the boil over a high heat

Strip your thyme leaves into the pan, then discard the stems and cook for 3-4 min or until thickened slightly – this is your lean beef mixture</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Season the lean beef mixture with a generous grind of pepper, then transfer to an oven-proof dish

Top the lean beef mixture with the chips

Tip: Try to put the crispiest chips at the bottom and balance the rest over the top so that they don’t sink!

Put the dish in the oven for 15-20 min or until the chips are crispy and cooked through (no pink meat!)  – this is your chip-topped lean beef & thyme pie</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the pie is almost done, reboil a kettle

Add your blanched peas to a pot, cover them with boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cook for 1-2 min or until bright green and tender

Once done, drain the peas and return them to the pot with a knob of butter and a pinch of salt</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the chip-topped beef & thyme pie with the peas to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
