<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the diced onion and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to soften

Once softened, add the chopped garlic, tomato and pepper to the pan with your 'Nduja (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and cook for 3-4 min or until the pepper is beginning to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, dissolve your chicken stock mix and tomato paste in 250ml <span class="text-purple">[325ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[425ml]</span> boiled water – this is your stock

Once the pepper has begun to soften, add the stock to the pan with the spinach, half the chopped basil (save the rest for garnish!) and a pinch of sugar and give everything a good mix up

Season with a grind of pepper and cook for 7-8 min or until the spinach has wilted and the sauce has thickened – this is your 'Nduja pepper sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the chopped potato is slightly brown, remove from the oven, then add the ciabatta slices to the other side of the baking tray[s] with a generous drizzle of olive oil and top with the grated cheddar cheese

Put the tray[s] in the oven for a further 4-5 min or until the cheese is melted and golden – these are your cheesy ciabatta slices</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Heat a separate, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-low heat

Once hot, crack your egg[s] into the pan, then cover with a lid and cook for 2-3 min or until done to your liking

Season with a grind of black pepper

Tip: Give your eggs a little shake before you crack for perfectly centred yolks!</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the 'Nduja pepper sauce with the crispy potatoes and cheesy ciabatta slices to the side

Top with the fried eggs and garnish with the remaining chopped basil – this is your Italian-style brunch with spicy 'Nduja eggs

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
