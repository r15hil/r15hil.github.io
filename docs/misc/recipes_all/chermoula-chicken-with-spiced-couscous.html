<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add your parsley and coriander (including the stalks!) with the peeled garlic and juice of half your lemon[s] to a food processor

Add your ground cumin, ground paprika, cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) with 2 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 3/4 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[5 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Blitz until smooth – this is your chermoula

Tip: If you don’t have a food processor, use a pestle & mortar!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Top, tail, peel and grate your carrot[s] and cut the remaining lemon into wedges

Drain the soaked sultanas

Add the onion petals (save the pan), grated carrot, drained sultanas, chipotle paste (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and the juice of half your lemon wedges to the drained couscous

Give everything a good mix up – this is your spiced giant couscous</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Wipe the reserved pan clean and return it to a high heat with a drizzle of olive oil

Once hot, add the marinated chicken with all of the chermoula and cook for 10-12 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your chermoula chicken</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the chermoula chicken over the spiced giant couscous

Drizzle over any remaining chermoula from the pan with the chicken and garnish with a lemon wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
