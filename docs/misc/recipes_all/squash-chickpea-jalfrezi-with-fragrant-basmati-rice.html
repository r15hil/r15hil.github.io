<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ 425°F/ Gas 7

Peel and finely slice the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid), with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a big pinch of salt and 2 tsp <span class="text-danger">[3 tsp] </span>sugar and cook for 5-8 min or until softened and starting to caramelise

Whilst the onion softens, boil a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a pot (with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a large knob of butter over a medium heat

Once the butter has melted, add the nigella seeds and basmati rice and stir to fully coat the grains in oil</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add 300ml<span class="text-danger"> [600ml]</span> boiled water to the rice, increase the heat to high and bring to the boil

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving – this is your fragrant basmati rice

Meanwhile, reboil a kettle</p><br><br>

Dissolve the vegetable stock mix and tomato paste in 300ml<span class="text-danger"> [600ml] </span>boiled water

Drain and rinse the chickpeas</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the chopped ginger, garlic, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), drained chickpeas and curry powder to the pan and stir until everything is coated in the spices

Add the tomato wedges and stock to the pan

Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook, covered for 15-18 min or until the squash is tender and the sauce has reduced – this is your butternut squash & chickpea jalfrezi</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Fluff the fragrant basmati rice with a fork and stir in a knob of butter

Taste for seasoning (add some pepper if you like it hot!) and serve the butternut squash & chickpea jalfrezi with the fragrant basmati rice on the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
