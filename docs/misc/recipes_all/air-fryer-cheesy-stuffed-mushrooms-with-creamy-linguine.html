<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the air fryer to 180°C and boil a kettle

Add your linguine to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the linguine for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the linguine, reserving 100ml <span class="text-purple">[130ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[150ml]</span> starchy pasta water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the pasta is cooking, trim, then slice your spring onion[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Grate your lighter cheese</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Combine the sliced spring onion with the chopped garlic and grated cheddar in a small bowl

Add half your pine nuts (you'll use the rest later!) and a generous grind of black pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your cheesy stuffing</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add the cheesy stuffing to your flat white mushroom[s] and top with the remaining pine nuts

Add the stuffed mushroom to the air fryer basket with a spray of olive oil and cook for 8-10 min or until the cheese is golden and the mushroom is tender – this is your cheesy stuffed mushroom

Tip: Air fryers work best when the food is spaced out in a single layer. You may need to do this in batches!</p><br><br>

<p>While the mushroom[s] are cooking, dissolve your vegetable stock mix and soft cheese in 75ml <span class="text-purple">[100ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[125ml] </span>starchy pasta water – this is your creamy veg stock

Peel your Italian hard cheese until you end up with a pile of cheese shavings</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>

Tip: Add a splash of water if it's looking a little dry</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Wash your spinach, then pat dry with kitchen paper

Once fully combined, gently stir through the spinach until wilted – this is your creamy linguine</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the cheesy stuffed mushroom over the creamy linguine

Sprinkle over the cheese shavings and season with a generous grind of black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
