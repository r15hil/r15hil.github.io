<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces

Cut your red onion[s] into wedges, leaving the skins on (this helps them cook quicker)

Chop your courgette[s] into thick discs, approx. 2cm thick</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Strip your rosemary leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems

Tip: Hold the top of the herb sprigs firmly and slide your fingers down their lengths to easily remove the leaves</p><br><br>

Add the rosemary leaves, dried oregano, a pinch of salt and a generous drizzle of olive oil and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 25-30 min or until the veg is soft and the potatoes are crisp</p><br><br>
