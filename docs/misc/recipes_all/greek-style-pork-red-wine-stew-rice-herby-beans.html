<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6 and boil a full kettle, then take your steak out of the fridge, open the packet and let it adjust to room temperature

Heat a large, wide-based hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid, with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Pat your pork loin steak[s] dry with kitchen paper and cut into large bite-sized pieces</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once hot, add the chopped pork loin to the dish and cook for 2 min or until lightly browned

Meanwhile, peel and chop your brown onion[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>into wedges

Crush your garlic open by squashing it with the side of a knife and discard the skin</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Remove the dish from the heat and add the onion wedges with your coriander seeds, garlic, red wine stock paste, chicken stock mix, tomato paste, half your dried oregano, your bay leaf[ves], 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour and a pinch of salt

Add 350ml <span class="text-purple">[525ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[700ml] </span>boiled water and stir it all together

Put the dish in the oven, lid on, for 60 min or until the sauce has thickened and the pork is tender and cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your Greek-style pork Afelia</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the pork has had 25 min, reboil the kettle

Add your white long grain rice to an oven-proof dish with a knob of butter, a pinch of salt and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> boiled water

Cover tightly with tin foil and put the dish in the oven for 30 min or until all the water is absorbed and the rice is cooked – this is your buttery baked rice</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>When the rice and pork have 15 min left, trim, then chop your green beans into bite-sized pieces and add to a large piece of tin foil (or two!) with a knob of butter, the remaining dried oregano, a pinch of salt and pepper and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> cold water

Scrunch the foil around the beans to form a tightly sealed parcel[s] and add to a baking tray

Put the tray in the oven for 10-12 min or until the beans are tender – these are your herby beans</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Greek-style pork, baked buttery rice and herby beans
