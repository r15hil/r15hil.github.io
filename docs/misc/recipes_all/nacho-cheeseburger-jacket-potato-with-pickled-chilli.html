<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil half a kettle

Pierce your red potato[es] a few times with a fork, then cook in the microwave for 7-8 min or until slightly softened

Add the softened potato[es] to a baking paper-lined baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt

Put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until crispy on the outside</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Whilst the potato[es] is cooking, peel and finely dice your red onion[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Slice your green chilli[es] finely

Add the sliced chilli to a small bowl with your cider vinegar and a pinch of salt and sugar

Give everything a good mix up and set aside – this is your quick-pickled chilli</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your beef mince with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

Once browned, add the diced onion and chopped garlic and cook for a further 3-4 min or until softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, grate your cheddar cheese

Dissolve your beef stock mix and Henderson's Relish in 50ml <span class="text-purple">[65ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[80ml] </span>boiled water – this is your Henderson's stock

Once softened, add the Henderson's stock to the pan and cook for a further 1-2 min or until the beef is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the sauce has thickened – this is your burger mix</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Combine the grated cheese with your cornflour in a separate large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) and mix until the cheese is coated in the flour

Add 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> milk to the pan with a pinch of salt and pepper

Cook over a medium heat for 2-3 min, stirring frequently, or until the cheese has melted and the sauce has thickened – this is your cheese sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the potato[es] is crispy, remove the tray from the oven and carefully slice a cross through the centre, taking care not to cut all the way through

Fill each potato with the burger mix and top with the cheese sauce

Return the tray to oven for 3-4 min or until piping hot – this is your nacho cheeseburger jacket potato</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Combine your mustard ketchup, mayo and tomato ketchup in a small bowl – this is your burger sauce

Wash your baby leaf salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the nacho cheeseburger jacket potato, drizzle over the burger sauce and top with the quick-pickled chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Serve the baby leaf salad to the side and drizzle over a little olive oil and pickling liquid

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
