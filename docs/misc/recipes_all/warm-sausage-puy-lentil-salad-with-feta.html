<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Rinse your brown rice, then add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and your bay leaf[ves] and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 20-25 min or until it’s tender with a slight bite, then drain, return it to the pot, discard the bay leaf[ves] and keep covered until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, cut your red onion[s] into wedges, leaving the skins and roots on (this helps them cook quicker)

Add your sausages and onion wedges to a baking tray (use tin foil to avoid mess!) with a little olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Put the tray in the oven for 25 min or until the sausages are cooked through (no pink meat!) and the onion is tender</p><br><br>

<p>Top, tail and slice your radishes (as finely as you can)

Slice your apple[s] finely, discard the core[s] then chop into matchsticks</p><br><br>
