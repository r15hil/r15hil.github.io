<p><strong>Description:</strong> Ratatouille, traditionally a French stew of sweet mixed vegetables, normally requires hours of slow cooking. We've simplified this method by tossing vegetables in olive oil and roasting them in a hot oven, then combining them with a rich tomato sauce. Sat over nutty wheat berries, dressed in a cheese and basil pesto. Ratatou-easy!</p>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, grind the chopped basil&nbsp;and a pinch of salt in a pestle &amp; mortar to form a smooth paste


Add 2-3 tbsp olive oil and most of the grated cheese, then&nbsp;transfer to a larger bowl


Tip: if you don't have a pestle &amp; mortar, chop the basil leaves very finely and mix with olive oil


Add the drained wheat berries and mix to combine - these are your pesto wheat berries</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the ratatouille over the&nbsp;pesto wheat berries


Top with the remaining grated cheese&nbsp;and a generous grind of black pepper


Enjoy!&nbsp;</p><br><br>
