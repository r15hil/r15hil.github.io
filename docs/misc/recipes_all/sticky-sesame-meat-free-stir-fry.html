<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Add your white long grain rice, a pinch of salt and 225ml [300ml] <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Whilst the rice is cooking, deseed your peppers (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and chop into large, bite-sized pieces

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chopped peppers with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until softened slightly</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Return the pan to a high heat with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil

Once very hot, add your meat-free mince (remove the paper if required!) and cook for 5-6 min or until browned all over, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the mince has browned, add your cornflour, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), ginger paste and chopped garlic and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add your soy sauce and agave, then return the softened peppers to the pan and cook for 1-2 min or until sticky and the meat-free mince is cooked through</p><br><br>
