<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Boil a kettle

Peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 5-7 min or until starting to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix, chopped creamed coconut and a large pinch of sugar in 500ml <span class="text-purple">[650ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[850ml]</span> boiled water – this is your coconut stock

Once the onion has softened, add your ground turmeric, curry powder and chopped garlic and cook for 1-2 min further or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, rinse your red lentils in a sieve under cold running water and add them to the pan with the coconut stock

Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook for 25-30 min or until the lentils are almost cooked and the sauce has thickened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>While the lentils are cooking, dice your free range chicken breast portion[s] into small bite-sized pieces

Add the diced chicken to a bowl with your ground paprika, nigella seeds and a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up – this is your marinated chicken

Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Chop your baby plum tomatoes in half</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add the halved tomatoes to the pan and cook for 5-7 min further or until the tomatoes have softened and the lentils are fully cooked

Stir most of the chopped coriander (save some for garnish!) through the lentils – this is your tomato & coconut dal</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Heat a separate large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the marinated chicken and cook for 7-8 min

Add your cider vinegar and cook for 3-4 min further or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your paprika chicken

Add your garlic & coriander naan[s] to a toaster for 1-2 min or until warmed through</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the paprika free range chicken over the tomato & coconut dal with a warmed naan to the side

Garnish with the remaining chopped coriander

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
