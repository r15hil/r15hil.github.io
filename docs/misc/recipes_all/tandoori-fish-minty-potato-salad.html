<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle

Once cooked, drain, and return to the pot</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Strip your mint leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, combine your curry powder with a generous pinch of salt and pepper on a plate

Add your basa fillet[s] to the plate and cover until completely coated

Heat a large wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]<span class="text-danger"> </span>[2 tbsp] </span>vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the coated basa and cook for 4-5 min on each side or until cooked through – this is your curried basa

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>
