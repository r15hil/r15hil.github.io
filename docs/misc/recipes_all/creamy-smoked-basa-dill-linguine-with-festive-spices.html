<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) over a medium-high heat

Add 250ml<span class="text-danger"> [500ml]</span> milk to the pan with the smoked basa, dried sage, bay leaf<span class="text-danger">[ves]</span>, studded onion half<span class="text-danger">[ves]</span> and a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Cover with a lid and bring to the boil

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 3-4 min or until the basa is cooked through

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once the basa is cooked through, transfer it to a plate – this is your creamy smoked basa

Pour the milk from the pan into a jug (save the pan for later!) – this is your spiced milk

<p>Add the linguine to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the linguine for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the cooked linguine, reserving 50ml <span class="text-danger">[75ml]</span> of the starchy pasta water

<h4>Step 7</h4>

Cook for 3-4 min or until the spiced milk has thickened

Once thickened, stir through the garlic & herb spread, the creamy smoked basa chunks, chopped spinach and chopped dill

Cook everything for 2 min further or until the spinach has wilted – this is your creamy smoked basa & dill</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To serve, add the cooked linguine to the pan with the creamy smoked basa & dill and coat it in the sauce – this is your creamy smoked basa & dill linguine with festive spices
