<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Add the basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat


Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Once the rice is cooked, drain and rinse in a sieve under cold running water, then keep aside to drain fully


Meanwhile, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat


Once hot, add the chicken thighs with the hoisin sauce and a generous pinch of salt and cook for 8-10 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the chicken thighs are cooked, transfer to a clean board and shred them apart, using two forks - this technique is known as 'pulling'


Reserve the pan for later</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil 


Once the pan is hot, add the chopped onion, carrot and green beans and cook for 5-6 min or until starting to soften 


Once softened, add the ginger &amp; garlic paste with the drained sweetcorn and cook for 5-6 min further or until softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once softened, make a well in the centre of the pan and add a drizzle of vegetable oil 


Crack the egg<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> into the well, break the yolk<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> up with a spatula then allow the egg to set slightly before mixing it through the vegetables


Add the basmati rice with the shredded chicken and cook for 3-4 min further or until starting to crisp up</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, trim, then slice the spring onions finely


Once the rice is starting to crisp, add the soy sauce with a generous pinch of black pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your chicken &amp; egg fried rice</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the chicken &amp; egg fried rice and garnish with the sliced spring onions


Enjoy!</p><br><br>
