<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the panko breadcrumbs and a pinch of salt

Cook for 6-8 min or until golden, stirring frequently

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don’t burn!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel the garlic

Zest the lemon<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> (try to grate lightly with a micro-plane or sharp box grater and avoid grating the white pith, as this is very bitter), then roll with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice) and cut in half

Chop the Tenderstem broccoli in half</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add the spinach & ricotta ravioli and halved broccoli to a pot of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook for 3-4 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the cooked ravioli and cooked broccoli, reserving the pot and a cup of the starchy pasta water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add half the cooked broccoli (save the rest for later!) to a food processor with the peeled garlic, flaked almonds and half the grated Italian hard cheese (you'll use the rest later)

Tip: No food processor? Chop everything up as finely as you can and mix it together!

Add the juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lemon, 2.5 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Blitz until you are left with a smooth paste – this is your broccoli pesto

Cut the remaining lemon into wedges

Once the breadcrumbs are golden, transfer them to a bowl with the lemon zest, give everything a good mix up and set aside for serving – this is your lemony pangrattato</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pot to a medium heat and add the drained ravioli and remaining broccoli

Add the broccoli pesto and stir gently until the pasta is nicely coated in the pesto and everything is warmed through – this is your broccoli pesto ravioli

Tip: Add a splash of starchy pasta water if your sauce is looking a little dry</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the broccoli pesto ravioli with the lemony pangrattato on top and lemon wedges to the side

Garnish with the remaining grated Italian hard cheese, a grind of black pepper and a drizzle of olive oil

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
