Add your tortillas to a baking tray, then put the tray in the oven for 2-3 min or until they're warmed through (alternatively, add them to a plate and microwave for 20 secs on high!)</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Top your warmed tortillas with the baked veggie 'Nduja taco filling, shredded lettuce and the coriander lime crema – these are your veggie 'Nduja & butter bean tacos with lime crema

Garnish with a lime wedge
