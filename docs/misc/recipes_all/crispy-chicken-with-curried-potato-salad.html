<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air, then preheat oven to to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat, then pat your chicken thighs dry with kitchen paper and season them generously on both sides with salt

Once hot, add the seasoned chicken thighs, skin-side down, and cook for 10 min or until the skins have browned and crisped</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, boil a kettle

Chop your waxy potatoes into large, bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>

Transfer the crispy chicken to a baking tray (skin side up) and put the tray in the oven for 12-15 min further or until cooked through (no pink meat!)

Reserve the pan and any remaining juices</p><br><br>

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 3-4 min or until tender
