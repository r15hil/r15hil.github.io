<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6 and boil half a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based, hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid with a little drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Peel and chop your red onion[s] into wedges

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and roughly chop

Once hot, add the onion wedges, chopped pepper and your butternut squash cubes to the oven-proof casserole dish and cook for 1 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Drain and rinse your black beans

Add your ginger & garlic paste to the dish with your ground smoked paprika, ground cumin, ground coriander and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>flour and stir it all together</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add your chopped tomatoes to the dish with your vegetable stock mix, soy sauce and 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [200ml]</span> boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the stew has been in the oven for 25 min, chop your tortillas into quarters (keep them stacked for speedy chopping!)

Add the tortilla quarters to a baking tray (or two) with a drizzle of olive oil

Put the tray[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>in the oven for 3-4 min or until warmed through and lightly golden around the edges</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the spiced butternut squash & pepper stew with the crispy tortillas and your soured cream to the side

Chop your chives roughly over the soured cream with scissors
