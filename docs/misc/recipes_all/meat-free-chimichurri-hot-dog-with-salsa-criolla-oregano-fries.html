<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking tray (or two) with a drizzle of vegetable oil, your dried oregano and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp – these are your oregano fries</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Peel and finely slice half your red onion[s]

Dice your remaining red onion finely</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add your meat-free hot dog sausage[s] to one side of a tin foil-lined baking tray and the sliced red onion next to the sausage[s] (you’ll use the chopped onion later!)

Add a small drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of sugar to the onion and give everything a good mix up

Arrange the onion in a pile next to the sausage[s] (this prevents them from burning whilst cooking) and put the tray in the oven for an initial 17-18 min or until the sausage[s] are golden and cooked through</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, chop your parsley finely, including the stalks

Dice your tomato[es] finely

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add your chopped tomato to a bowl with your chopped red onion and half your red wine vinegar

Add a pinch of salt and pepper, a drizzle of olive oil and a generous pinch of sugar

Stir it all together – this is your salsa criolla</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>In a separate bowl, combine the chopped parsley with the chopped garlic (not a big garlic fan? try using less!), half your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) (save the rest for another recipe!) and the remaining red wine vinegar

Add 1 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>olive oil with a pinch of sugar and salt

Give everything a good mix up – this is your chimichurri</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the sausage[s] have had an initial 17-18 min, add your hot dog bun[s] to the other side of the baking tray and cook for 3 min or until warmed through

Cut a slit into the top of the warmed hot dog bun[s]</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To build, spread your vegan mayo inside each bun, then fill with a meat-free hot dog

Top with the caramelised onion, chimichurri and some of the salsa criolla

Serve with the oregano fries and remaining salsa criolla to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
