<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the basmati rice and 300ml<span class="text-danger"> [600ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Drain and rinse the jackfruit then transfer it to a clean board and shred apart using two forks – this technique is known as 'pulling'

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt over a medium-high heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once hot, add the onion, garlic and half the green chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and cook for 3-4 min or until softened

Once the onion has softened, add the ground fenugreek, ground cumin, curry powder and ground turmeric and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant

Add the pulled jackfruit, mix everything together and cook for 2-3 min further</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Whilst the jackfruit is cooking, cut 1 <span class="text-danger">[2]</span> piece<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> of tin foil approx. the size of an A3 sheet of paper

Lay the green beans in the middle with the black mustard seeds, a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt

Scrunch the edges of the foil around the beans to form a sealed parcel

Put the parcel<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in the oven for 6-8 min or until vibrant with a bite</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the sauce has reduced, stir through the coconut yoghurt and cook for 1 min further – this is your Keralan jackfruit & green chilli curry

Tip: If your sauce is looking a little dry, add a splash of water!</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Keralan jackfruit & green chilli curry with the mustard seed beans and basmati rice to the side

Sprinkle over the fried onions and garnish with the remaining green chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
