Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked 

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving</p><br><br>

<p>Whilst the pork is cooking, peel and finely slice (don't chop!) the garlic

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) the ginger

Wash, then rip the leaves off the spring greens, discard the tough stalks, then layer the leaves over each other, roll them up and slice into thin strips, then pat dry with kitchen paper

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Combine the hoisin sauce, rice vinegar and soy sauce in a small bowl – this is your hoisin sauce

Once the pork is cooked, reduce the heat to low and add the hoisin sauce to the pan

Cook for a further 1 min, turning the pork steaks several times until they're nicely coated

Remove the pan from the heat and set aside to rest for a couple of min – these are your Taiwanese-style pork steaks</p><br><br>

<p>Heat a separate large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with the toasted sesame oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced spring greens, spinach, sliced garlic, and chopped ginger with a pinch of salt

Give it a good mix up and cook, covered for 3-4 min or until tender – these are your sesame greens</p><br><br>
