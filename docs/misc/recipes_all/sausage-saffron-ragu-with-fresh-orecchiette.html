<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let’s get started!

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Add your sausage meat (remove the paper if required!) to the pan with your bay leaf[ves]<span class="text-danger"> </span>and a pinch of salt and cook for 2-3 min or until beginning to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add your fresh orecchiette to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the orecchiette for 4-6 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Peel and slice (don't chop!) your garlic

Combine your chicken stock mix, tomato paste and saffron with 250ml <span class="text-purple">[325ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[425ml]</span> boiled water – this is your saffron stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the sausage meat is starting to brown, add the sliced garlic to the pan and cook for 1 min further or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add your Chinese rice wine and saffron stock and cook for 2-3 min further or until the sauce thickens slightly and the sausage meat is cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the sauce has thickened, add a knob of butter and half your cracked black pepper (you'll use the rest later!) and give everything a good mix up – this is your sausage & saffron ragù</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Stir the drained orecchiette into the sauce and give everything a gentle mix up until the pasta is coated in the sauce, discard the bay leaf[ves]

Tip: Add a splash of starchy pasta water if your sauce is looking a little dry</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the sausage & saffron ragù with fresh orecchiette and top with your grated Italian hard cheese and the remaining cracked black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
