<h4>Step 1</h4>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced red onion, beef mince, ground smoked paprika, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 4-5 min or until the beef mince is starting to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

Once slightly browned, add the chopped tomato and cook for a further 1-2 min or until the tomato has softened – this is your spiced beef</p><br><br>

Add your chicken stock mix, white long grain rice and a pinch of salt with 350ml <span class="text-purple">[525ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[700ml] </span>boiled water and give everything a good mix up

Cover tightly with tin foil, and put the dish in the oven for 30 min or until all the water is absorbed and the rice and beef are cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

Mix everything together – this is your burger sauce

Combine the diced tomato with the drained quick pickled onion & cucumber – this is your tomato relish</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the 'cheeseburger' rice bake with some of the burger sauce drizzled all over

Top with the tomato relish

Combine the remaining burger sauce with any remaining tomato relish and serve to the side – this is your saucy relish

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
