<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Rinse your brown rice, then add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 15-20 min or until it's tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain and return it to the pot and keep covered until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a matching lid with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-low heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion and cook for 8-10 min or until softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, drain and rinse your sweetcorn

Chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Dissolve the chopped creamed coconut and vegetable stock mix in 375ml <span class="text-purple">[560 ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[700ml]</span> boiled water – this is your coconut stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>

Meanwhile, cut the smoked basa fillets into bite-sized pieces

Wash the spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the smoked basa pieces and spinach to the pan and cook, covered, for 4 min or until the spinach has wilted and the fish is cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

Remove the lid from the pan and gently stir the curry

Cook for a further 3-4 min or until the sauce has thickened to a curry-like consistency – this is your smoked basa & sweetcorn curry</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the smoked basa & sweetcorn curry to the side of the brown rice

Garnish with the reserved chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
