<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add your fresh orecchiette to a pot of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the sauce has thickened, add the drained orecchiette to the pan with half the chopped parsley (save the rest for garnish!) and a generous grind of black pepper

Give everything a good mix up until the pasta is coated in the sauce â€“ this is your puttanesca-style sauce with fresh orecchiette

Tip: Add a splash of starchy pasta water if your sauce is looking a little dry!</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the puttanesca-style sauce with fresh orecchiette topped with the remaining chopped parsley and a generous grind of black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
