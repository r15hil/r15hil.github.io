<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut half of your<span class="text-danger"> </span>potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to one side of the baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 30-35 min or until golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Peel and grate the remaining potato[es]

Add the grated potato to the middle of a tea towel and bring the four corners together to form a ball

Twist the ball and squeeze out as much of the liquid as you can

Add the squeezed potato to a bowl with your smoked paprika and a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your paprika potato mixture</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Peel and slice your red onion[s] into rounds (approx. 1cm thick)

Once the chips have had an initial 15 minutes, remove the tray from the oven and add the red onion rounds to the other side

Drizzle half of your balsamic vinegar (you'll use the rest later!) over the red onion rounds with a little olive oil and return to the oven until caramelised and crispy – these are your balsamic onions</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the paprika potato mixture with a pinch of salt and cook for 8-10 min or until crispy and golden – these are your speedy paprika röstis

Tip: Don't worry how they look, you're just after the crunch!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Line a separate baking tray with baking paper

Add your ultimate vegan burger patties to the lined tray and put the tray in the oven for 10-12 min or until cooked through

Combine your mayo and tomato ketchup in a bowl – this is your ketchup mayo</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Cut your mature cheddar style block into 1 slice[s] per person

Once the patties have cooked through, remove the tray from the oven and top each patty with a mature cheddar style slice

Slice your brioche buns in half and add them to the other side of the tray

Return the tray to the oven for 3-4 min or until the mature cheddar style slice has melted and the brioche is warmed through</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Wash your lettuce and pat it dry with kitchen paper

Remove the leaf[ves] from the lettuce for per person and set aside, then tear the remaining lettuce into rough, bite-sized pieces</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To assemble your burger, spread each warmed brioche base with ketchup mayo

Layer up the ultimate vegan burger patties, reserved lettuce leaves, a couple of the balsamic onions and the speedy paprika röstis and top with a warmed brioche lid

Serve the chips and torn lettuce leaves to the side with the remaining balsamic vinegar and a drizzle of olive oil

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
