<p><strong>Description:</strong> As part of our Savour the Summer campaign, we present this Thai-inspired red noodle curry bowl, a summery take on a curry. Unlike other cheese, you can cook paneer, giving it a lovely golden colour. It's mild flavour works perfectly in a curry, served with juicy grapes and savoury spring onions for crunch and lift. Paneereasy! </p>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, place&nbsp;the coconut cream sachet<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in a mug and cover with boiled water (this softens the naturally hard cream)


Add the rice noodles to a pot and cover with boiled water, then cook for 6 min over a high heat


Once&nbsp;cooked, drain, rinse with cold water and return them to the pot

<p>Serve the noodle curry in bowls and garnish with the remaining spring onion


Enjoy!</p><br><br>
