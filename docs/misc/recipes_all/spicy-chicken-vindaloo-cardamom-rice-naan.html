<p><strong>Description:</strong> This dish is a fusion of East and West, with the influence of Portugal shining through. Vinegar was brought over to India in the 16th century by the Portuguese, and thus the characteristic hot, sour flavours of the vindaloo were born. Basil adds a subtle anise flavour. If you like spice, you'll vinda-love it!</p>

<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air, then peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid), with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 7-8 min or until softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, chop your chicken breast strips into bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped chicken to a bowl with your cider vinegar, ground cumin, ground paprika, half your cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up – this is your coated chicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle

Peel and finely slice your garlic

Chop your cherry tomatoes in half

Dissolve your chicken stock mix and tamarind paste in 150ml<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[200ml] </span>[250ml]</span> boiled water – this is your tamarind stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the onion has softened, add a knob of butter with the halved tomatoes and sliced garlic and cook for 6-8 min further or until the tomatoes are starting to break down

Crush your cardamom pods open by squashing them with the side of a knife</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add your basmati rice, crushed cardamom pods, a pinch of salt and 300ml<span class="text-purple"> [390ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [600ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving – this is your cardamom rice</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the tomatoes have started to break down, increase the heat to medium-high, then add the coated chicken, half your basil leaves (save the rest for garnish!) and a grind of black pepper and cook for 3-4 min or until the spices are fragrant

Reduce the heat to medium, then add the tamarind stock and cook, covered, for 8-10 min or until the sauce has thickened and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your spicy chicken vindaloo</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add your garlic & coriander naan[s] to a toaster for 1-2 min or until warmed through

Slice the remaining basil leaves finely

Tip: Once the vindaloo is done, taste the sauce and stir through any remaining cayenne if it needs more kick!</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the spicy chicken vindaloo with the cardamom rice and warmed naan to the side

Tip: Watch out for any cardamom pods!

Garnish with the sliced basil leaves

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
