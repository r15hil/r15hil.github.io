<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Top, tail and chop your courgette[s] into quarters lengthways, then slice finely

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick, with a matching lid), over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your chicken breast portion and cook for 3 min on each side or until golden, then add a couple of splashes of water to the pan and cover with a lid, then cook for a further 10-12 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle, then heat a separate large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick), with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once the pan is hot, add the sliced courgette with a pinch of salt and cook, covered, for 1-2 min or until starting to soften

Chop your cherry tomatoes in half

Once the courgette has slightly softened, add your roasted garlic paste, dried oregano and the halved tomatoes and cook for a further 2-3 min or until the tomatoes have started to break down</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add your gnocchi to a pot of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the gnocchi for 3 min or until it begins to rise to the top of the pot

Once done, drain the gnocchi and reserve a cup of the starchy cooking water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the tomatoes have started to break down, add your chopped tomatoes and black olives with a generous pinch of black pepper and give everything a good mix up

Cook for 1-2 min or until the olives are warmed through – these are your Mediterranean-style vegetables</p><br><br>

<p>Chop your basil finely, including the stalks

Grate your cheddar cheese

Wash your spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Stir the drained gnocchi through the Mediterranean-style vegetables and season with pepper

Add the spinach to the pan and stir for 1-2 min until the spinach has wilted – this is your Mediterranean-style vegetable gnocchi

Tip: If the sauce is looking a little dry, add a splash of the reserved starchy cooking water</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Mediterranean-style vegetable gnocchi in a bowl and garnish with the chopped basil and grated cheese

Serve the cooked chicken breast to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
