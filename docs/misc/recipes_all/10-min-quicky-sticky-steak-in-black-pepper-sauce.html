<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready, then skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Before you start cooking, take your steak out of the fridge, open the packet and let it adjust to room temperature

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Boil half a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Season one side of your rump steak[s] with a pinch of salt and half your cracked black pepper (save the rest for later!), cover in cling film and bash with a rolling pin until flat and approx. 1 cm in thickness</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once very hot, add the seasoned steak to the pan

For rare, cook for 2 min max on each side; for medium-rare, cook for 2-3 min on each side; for medium, cook for 3-4 min on each side

Once the steak is cooked, transfer to a plate to rest and reserve the pan

Wash and pat dry with kitchen paper, then cut the base[s] off your pak choi and slice in half lengthways</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, heat a separate large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Remove the pan from the heat, add the halved pak choi, cut-side down, to the pan with a pinch of salt, then return to the heat and cook for 1-2 min or until browned

Add a splash of boiled water and cook, covered, for 1-2 min further or until tender</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Squeeze your pouch[es] of cooked brown long grain rice to separate the grains

Tear the top corner of the pouch[es] (just a little!) and microwave for 2 min or until piping hot

Tip: If you're cooking two or more pouches, pop them in together but increase the microwave cook time accordingly!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 8</h4>
