<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil half a kettle

Rinse your brown rice, add it to a pot (with a matching lid) with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 20-25 min or until it's tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain, return it to the pot and keep covered until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat with a drizzle of olive oil

Once hot, add your meat-free mince (remove the paper if required!) and cook for 3-4 min or until browned all over, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

Tip: Try not to stir too often so the mince gets nice and brown!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Whilst the meat-free mince is browning, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix, chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and your tomato paste in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[260ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[350ml] </span>boiled water – this is your chipotle stock

Drain and rinse your black beans</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add the chipotle stock, drained black beans and chilli flakes (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) to the pan and bring to the boil

Cook for 4-5 min or until the sauce has thickened – this is your spicy meat-free mince chilli</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Cut your avocado[s] in half lengthways, around the stone

Remove the stone[s] using a spoon, then scoop out the avocado flesh and dice roughly

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s]

Crumble your feta into large pieces using your hands

Cut your lime[s] in half</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Combine the diced avocado, sliced spring onion and crumbled feta in a small bowl

Add the juice of half the lime[s] and stir it all together – this is your feta & avocado salsa

Cut the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the spicy meat-free mince chilli with the brown rice and feta & avocado salsa to the side

Garnish with a lime wedge
