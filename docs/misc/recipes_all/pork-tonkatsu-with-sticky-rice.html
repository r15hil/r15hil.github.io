<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you start cooking, take your pork loin steak[s] out of the fridge, open the packet and let it adjust to room temperature

Rinse your sushi rice in a sieve under cold running water for 30 secs (use your hands to really wash the grains!), then set aside to drain fully

Add the drained rice with 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> cold water and a pinch of salt to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Once boiling, reduce the heat to low until very gently bubbling and cook, covered, for 15 min

After 15 min, remove the pot from the heat and keep covered for a further 10 min before serving – this is your sticky rice

Tip: Don't peek! Keep the lid on the whole time to get fluffy and sticky rice!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Cover your steak[s] in cling film and bash them with a rolling pin until evenly flattened to approx. 1 cm in thickness

Add a handful of flour to a plate with a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Add a generous splash of<span class="text-danger"> </span>milk to a shallow bowl

Add the panko breadcrumbs to a separate plate</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Coat the flattened steak[s] in the flour, tap off the excess, then add them to the milk and then firmly press into the breadcrumbs to evenly coat all over

Tip: Make sure the steak[s] is fully coated in the breadcrumbs!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a very generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coated pork steak[s] and cook for 6-7 min on each side or until golden and cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your pork Tonkatsu

Once done, transfer the pork Tonkatsu to a clean chopping board to rest for 2 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Whilst the steak[s] is cooking, add your carrot & cabbage slaw mix to a bowl with half your rice vinegar (you'll use the rest later!)

Add a drizzle of olive oil, a generous pinch of sugar and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up – this is your dressed slaw</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Combine your ketchup with your soy sauce, the chopped garlic and the remaining rice vinegar

Add 1 tsp<span class="text-purple"> [1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>sugar and 1 tsp<span class="text-purple"> [1 1/2 tsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tsp] </span>cold water and stir it all together – this is your Tonkatsu-style sauce

Whilst the pork is resting, pop the Tonkatsu-style sauce in the microwave for 20 secs on high or until warmed through</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Slice the pork Tonkatsu finely and serve with the sticky rice and dressed slaw to the side

Tip: For fancy presentation, press the rice into small bowls and turn out

Drizzle the Tonkatsu-style sauce all over the sliced pork

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
