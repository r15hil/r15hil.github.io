<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Peel and finely chop the shallot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Once hot, add the chopped shallot and meat-free mince to the pan and cook for 5-6 min<span class="text-danger"> </span>or until the mince is browned, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Once browned, transfer the mince to a bowl and add the smoked paprika, ground cumin, cayenne pepper and a pinch of salt – this is your smoky meat-free mince mixture

Cut the potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper, give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Dust a work surface with a small handful of flour

Unwrap the puff pastry and roll it out to approx. 0.5cm thickness with a rolling pin

Cut into 4 <span class="text-danger">[8] </span>rectangles and add them to a baking tray lined with non-stick baking paper

Divide the smoky meat-free mince mixture into 4 <span class="text-danger">[8]</span> and add to the middle of the pastry rectangles

Tip: Cooking for 4? Use 2 trays!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Brush a little cold water around the edges of the pastry

Tip: This helps to seal the pastry!

Fold the pastry over the smoky meat-free mince mixture so that both short sides of the rectangle are touching

Press the pastry together with your fingers to seal in the meat-free mince with as little air trapped inside as possible

Tip: Don't worry if they look messy, they'll be tidied up later!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Trim the edges of the pastry into a semi-circle shape

Use a fork to crimp the edges of the pastry and prick air holes in the top

Put the empanadas in the oven for 15-20 min or until golden brown – these are your smoky meat-free empanadas</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>While the empanadas are cooking, cut the red chilli<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely

Chop the parsley finely, including the stalks

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Combine the chopped chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!), parsley and garlic with the dried oregano, red wine vinegar and 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[3 tbsp]</span> olive oil – this is your chimichurri</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Wash the gem lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and chop into wedges

Combine half of the chimichurri (you'll use the rest for garnish!) with the mayo in a small bowl – this is your chimichurri mayo</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the smoky meat-free empanadas with the lettuce wedges, chips and chimichurri mayo to the side

Dollop the reserved chimichurri over the baby leaf salad

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
