<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add your bacon lardons and cook for 8 min, stirring frequently, or until golden and crispy</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the bacon lardons are cooking, peel and finely dice your brown onion[s]

Peel and finely slice (don't chop) your garlic

Slice your cherry tomatoes in half</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once the lardons are crispy, transfer them to a plate and return the pan (and oil!) to a medium heat

Add the diced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 6-7 min or until softened

Dissolve your tomato paste and chicken stock mix in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[160ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[300ml]</span> boiled water – this is your tomato stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the onion has softened, add the halved tomatoes, sliced garlic, dried oregano and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the pan and cook for 4-5 min further or until the tomatoes have broken down into a sauce

Once broken down, add the tomato stock with a pinch of sugar and cook for 3-4 min further or until the sauce has thickened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add your spaghetti to a pot of boiled water with a generous pinch of salt, bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the cooked spaghetti and reserve a cup of the starchy pasta water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the drained spaghetti to the sauce with half the chopped basil and half the crispy lardons (save the rest for garnish!) and give everything a good mix up until the sauce coats the pasta – this is your spaghetti Amatriciana

Tip: Add a splash of starchy pasta water if it's looking a little dry</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the spaghetti Amatriciana and garnish with the remaining crispy lardons and chopped basil

Sprinkle over your grated Italian hard cheese and season with a good grind of black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
