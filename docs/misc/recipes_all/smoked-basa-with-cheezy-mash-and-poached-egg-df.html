<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Chop your potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Reboil a kettle

Wash, then add your spinach to a colander and pour boiled water all over it so that it starts to wilt

Rinse the wilted spinach under the cold tap until it's cool

Once cool, squeeze the water out of the spinach as much as you can

Boil the kettle again (last time, we promise!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Place your smoked basa fillet[s] on a baking tray (use tin foil to avoid mess!)

Drizzle them with a little olive oil and season with a pinch of salt and pepper

Put the tray in the oven for 12-15 min or until the fish is cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>
