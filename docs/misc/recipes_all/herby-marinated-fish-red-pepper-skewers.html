<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut the potatoes (skins on) into wedges

Add the wedges to a large baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a generous pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up

Put the tray in the oven for 30-35 min or until the wedges are tender and starting to crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, deseed the pepper<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> and cut into bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped pepper to a separate baking tray (use tin foil to avoid mess!) with the smoked paprika, a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper and mix together

Put the tray in the oven for 5-6 min or until lightly charred and starting to soften, then remove from the oven and set aside</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, strip the mint leaves from their stems, then chop them finely and discard the stems

Chop the coriander finely, including the stalks

Peel and grate the garlic

Soak the skewers in cold water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Combine the grated garlic, ground turmeric and chopped mint in a bowl with half the natural yoghurt and half the chopped coriander (you'll use the rest later!)

Squeeze in the juice of 1/2<span class="text-danger"> [1]</span> lemon and season with a very generous pinch of salt and pepper – this is your herby marinade</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Thread the marinated basa and charred pepper (save the tray!) evenly onto the soaked skewers and season with a pinch of salt and pepper – these are your loaded skewers

Add the loaded skewers to the reserved tray and put the tray in the oven for 8-10 min or until the fish is cooked through – these are your herby basa & pepper skewers

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Combine the remaining natural yoghurt, lemon and coriander with a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your coriander yoghurt

Wash the baby leaf salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the herby basa & pepper skewers with the wedges and baby leaf salad to the side

Drizzle the salad with olive oil and finish with a crack of black pepper

Dollop the coriander yoghurt onto the plate ready for dipping

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
