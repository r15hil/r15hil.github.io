<p><strong>Description:</strong> Sausages and gnocchi are Northern Italian partners in crime. This method of cooking them on the same tray gives both the sausages AND the gnocchi lovely crisp skins, minus any faff. Keeping in with tradition, weâ€™ve served these guys with a simple tomato and spinach sauce. Bellisimo</p>
