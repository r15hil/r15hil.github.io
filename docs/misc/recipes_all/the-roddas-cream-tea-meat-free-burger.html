Add a generous drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up

Spread the potato discs into a single layer and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crispy – these are your salt & pepper slices

Tip: Cooking for 4? Use 2 trays!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a pot  with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped tomato with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until starting to break down

Once the tomato has started to break down, add the tomato paste, red wine vinegar, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> sugar and a generous pinch of salt

Cook for 10-15 min, stirring frequently, or until thickened to a jam-like consistency – this is your warming tomato jam</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the jam is done, transfer it to a bowl and leave to cool slightly

Tip: The jam will thicken whilst it cools!

Wash, then separate the lettuce leaves and pat them dry with kitchen paper

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>After 8 min, add the brioche halves to the other side of the tray and return the tray to the oven for 2-4 min or until the bread is lightly toasted and the burgers are cooked through

Tip: Cooking for 4? Use 2 trays!</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Build your burger by topping the toasted brioche base with the lettuce leaves, sliced tomato and a meat-free burger patty

Spoon over the warming tomato jam and the clotted cream (in whichever order you like!) and then top with the toasted brioche lid

Serve with the salt & pepper slices to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
