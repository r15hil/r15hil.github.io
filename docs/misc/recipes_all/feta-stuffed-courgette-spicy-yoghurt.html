<p><strong>Description:</strong> You may have heard of stuffed marrow, a classic old English vegetarian dish. These stuffed courgettes are the little sister to that dish, as courgettes are simply baby marrows. You'll stuff them with a baharat (7-spice), red onion, tomato and feta mix and serve them over a tomato oregano couscous with a spicy yoghurt side. A Mediterranean delight!</p>
