<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you start cooking take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air, then preheat the oven to 240ºC/ 220ºC (fan)/ gas 9 and boil half a kettle

Add your cashew nuts to a bowl, cover with 200ml <span class="text-purple">[260ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[340ml]</span> boiled water, then cover with a plate and set aside

Chop your chicken breast strips into bite-sized pieces</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml<span class="text-purple"> [300ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add the chopped chicken and natural yoghurt to a bowl with your cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), garam masala, ground turmeric, 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up – this is your marinated chicken

Transfer the marinated chicken to a baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!) and put in the oven for 6-8 min or until the chicken is slightly charred

Once done, set aside – this is your chicken tikka</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Heat a large wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add most of the diced onion (you'll use the rest later!) and a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until softened

Once softened, add the chopped ginger, chopped garlic and your tomato paste to the pan and cook for a further 1-2 min or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add the softened cashews and a splash of the soaking liquid (reserve the rest for later!) to a food processor and blitz the cashews as fine as possible

Add the creamy cashew paste and remaining soaking liquid to the pan with your chicken stock mix and the chicken tikka (and any juices from the tray[s])

Turn the heat up to high and cook for 7-8 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the sauce has thickened to a curry-like consistency – this is your creamy chicken makhani</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the diced cucumber and the remaining diced onion to a bowl with a drizzle of olive oil

Season with a pinch of salt and a generous grind of pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your cucumber salad</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the creamy chicken makhani over the cooked rice with the cucumber salad to the side

Tip: For fancy presentation, press the rice into a small bowl and turn out

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
