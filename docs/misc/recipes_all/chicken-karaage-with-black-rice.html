<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Rinse your brown rice, add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat, then once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 20-25 min or until it's tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain, return it to the pot and keep covered until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, slice each of your chicken breast portion[s] into 3-4 strips

Peel and finely chop (or grate) half of your garlic (you'll use the rest later!)

Peel your ginger (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and chop (or grate) finely</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add the chopped ginger, chopped garlic, soy sauce and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar to a bowl – this is your marinade

Add the chicken strips and give everything a good mix up, then set aside until later</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, wash your pak choi then cut in half, separating the white base and green tops

Peel and slice the remaining garlic finely

Add your mayo and rice vinegar to a bowl and combine – this is your Japanese-style mayo</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the pak choi white bases, toasted sesame seeds and sliced garlic with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until the pak choi has started to soften, then add the green pak choi tops and cook for a further 1 min

Transfer the cooked pak choi to a plate and keep the pan for later</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add your cornflour to a bowl

Add the marinated chicken strips, leaving most of the marinade behind

Give everything a good mix up so the chicken strips are fully coated in cornflour</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Return the pan to a high heat with enough vegetable oil to cover the bottom of the pan

Once hot, add the coated chicken and cook for 5-6 min on each side or until browned and cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your chicken karaage</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the chicken karaage with the brown rice, pak choi and Japanese-style mayo to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
