<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Heat a large, wide-based, hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Carefully pull the chicken skin off your chicken thighs

Add the chicken skin to a baking paper-lined baking tray and season with a pinch of salt</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Place another piece of baking paper over the chicken skin, then a second baking tray on top to weigh it down slightly

Put the stacked baking trays in the oven for 25-30 min or until the chicken skin is golden and crispy – this is your crispy chicken skin

Boil a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the dish is hot, add the skinless chicken thighs with a pinch of salt

Cook for 3-4 min or until starting to brown</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Whilst the chicken is browning, top, tail and chop your carrot[s] in half lengthways, then into bite-sized pieces

Peel and chop your brown onion[s] into wedges

Crush your garlic open by squashing them with the side of a knife and discard the skins</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>After an initial 10 min, remove the dish from the oven and stir through half your grated Italian hard cheese

Add your macaroni with your shredded kale, a pinch of salt and a generous grind of black pepper, then cover with a lid and return the dish to the oven for a further 15 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

Once done, use two forks to shred the chicken apart and stir through your crème fraîche – this is your creamy chicken soup with macaroni</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the creamy chicken soup with macaroni in a bowl, discard the bay leaf[ves]

Sprinkle over the remaining grated Italian hard cheese and garnish with the crispy chicken skin

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
