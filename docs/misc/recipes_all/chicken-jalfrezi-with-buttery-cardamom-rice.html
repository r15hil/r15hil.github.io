<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air, then heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a large drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Cut your chicken breast strips into bite-sized pieces, then once the pan is hot, add the diced chicken breast and cook for 4-5 min or until browned</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the chicken is browning, peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Once browned, transfer the browned chicken to a plate, reserve the pan and juices

Return the reserved pan to a medium heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the sliced onion with a pinch of salt, 2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[2 1/2 tsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [3 tsp]</span> sugar and cook for 5-8 min or until soft and starting to caramelise</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Boil a kettle

Crush your cardamom pods open by squashing them with the side of a knife

Heat a pot with a lid, with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a large knob of butter over a medium heat

Once the butter has melted, add the crushed cardamom and basmati rice and stir to fully coat the grains</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water to the pot and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>While the rice is cooking, deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

Add the pepper strips to the softened onion and cook for a further 5-8 min or until starting to brown, stirring occasionally

While the veg is browning, dissolve your chicken stock mix in 300ml <span class="text-purple">[450ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> boiled water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Cut your tomato[es] into wedges

Add the chopped ginger, chopped garlic, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and curry powder to the pan and stir until the veg is coated</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add your tomato paste and stir for 1 min, then return the browned chicken to the pan with the tomato wedges and chicken stock

Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook, covered, for 8-10 min or until the chicken has cooked through (no pink meat!) and the sauce has reduced to a curry-like consistency – this is your chicken jalfrezi

Taste for seasoning, adding more salt and pepper if needed</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Fluff the basmati rice with a fork and stir in a knob of butter – this is your buttery cardamom rice

Serve the chicken jalfrezi with the buttery cardamom rice to the side (discard the cardamom pods!)

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
