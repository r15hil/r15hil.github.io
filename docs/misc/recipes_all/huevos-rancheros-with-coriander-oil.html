<h4>Step 1</h4>

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and dice</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large pot with a generous drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add your ground smoked paprika, ground cumin and chopped garlic and cook for 30 secs

Add the diced pepper, chopped tomato and chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and cook for 2-3 min or until the pepper is beginning to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, drain and rinse your black beans

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> boiled water with your tomato paste and a pinch of sugar

Add the drained black beans to the pot with the tomato and cook for 5-8 min or until the sauce has thickened – these are your spicy beans</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, chop most of your coriander finely, including the stalks (save a few leaves for garnish!)

Add the chopped coriander to a pestle & mortar with a pinch of salt and a small splash of water

Grind the coriander to a paste, then add 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [4 tbsp]</span> olive oil – this is your coriander oil

Tip: Don't have a pestle and mortar? Just chop the coriander finely and mix it with the oil!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the sauce has thickened, remove the spicy beans from the heat, squeeze in the juice of half your lime[s] and mix everything together

Gently crush some of the beans lightly with a masher and season with a generous pinch of salt – these are your Mexican-style beans</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-low heat

Crack your egg[s] into the pan

Cover with a lid and cook for 2-3 min or until done to your liking

Tip: Give your eggs a little shake before you crack them for perfectly centred yolks!</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, chop the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person

Serve the Mexican-style beans over the warmed tortillas and top with the grated cheese and a fried egg – this is your huevos rancheros

Drizzle with the coriander oil and garnish with the reserved coriander leaves and a lime wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
