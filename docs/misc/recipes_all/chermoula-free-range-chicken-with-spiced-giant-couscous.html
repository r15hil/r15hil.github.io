Blitz until smooth – this is your chermoula

<p>Top, tail, peel and grate your carrot[s] and cut the remaining lemon into wedges

Drain the soaked sultanas

Add the onion petals (reserve the pan), grated carrot, drained sultanas, chipotle paste (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and the juice of half the lemon wedges to the drained couscous

Give everything a good mix up – this is your spiced giant couscous</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Wipe the reserved pan clean and return it to a high heat with a drizzle of olive oil

Once hot, add the marinated chicken with all of the chermoula and cook for 10-12 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your chermoula chicken</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the chermoula free range chicken over the spiced giant couscous

Drizzle over any remaining chermoula from the pan with the chicken and garnish with a lemon wedge

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
