<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into fries

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut in half

Add the fries and pepper halves to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper and put the tray in the oven for an initial 20 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Once the fries are in the oven, boil a kettle

Peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Combine your black bean paste and cornflour with 200ml <span class="text-purple">[260ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[350ml]</span> boiled water in a small bowl – this is you black bean stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Combine your beef mince and your five-spice mix in a bowl with a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up until thoroughly combined (clean hands are the best way!)

Divide and shape into 1 equal-sized patty per person and refrigerate until later</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add the sliced onion to a pot with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to soften

Once the onion has started to soften, add your ginger & garlic paste and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the black bean stock and cook for 8-10 min or until the sauce has begun to thicken to a gravy-like consistency – this is your black bean & onion gravy</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>While the gravy is cooking, heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat

Slice your brioche bun[s] in half

Once hot, add the brioche halves to the pan, cut-side down, and cook for 3-4 min or until toasted and golden, then transfer to a plate and set aside for later, reserve the pan</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pan to a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the beef patties, press them down firmly with a spatula and cook for 4-5 min on each side or until cooked through and charred (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, wash your shredded kale and pat it dry with kitchen paper

Combine the shredded kale with a pinch of salt, 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil in a large bowl – this is your 'seaweed'

After the fries have had an initial 20 min, remove the baking tray from the oven and top the fries with the 'seaweed'

Return the baking tray to the oven for a further 4-5 min or until the 'seaweed' is crisp and the fries are golden</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To build your burger, top the toasted brioche base with a roasted pepper half, a handful of crispy 'seaweed', a beef patty, the black bean & onion sauce and finally the toasted brioche lid

Sprinkle your toasted sesame seeds over the fries and serve to the side with the remaining crispy 'seaweed'

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
