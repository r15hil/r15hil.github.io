<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips, then add them to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 30 min or until golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add your ground smoked paprika to a plate with a grind of black pepper

Add your chicken breast strips to the plate and turn them several times in the spices until they're nicely coated</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the coated chicken and cook for 3 min on each side or until starting to brown</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Transfer the browned chicken to a tin foil-lined baking tray and scrunch the edges of the foil up a little around it

Tip: This will help to keep the sauce around your chicken!

Drizzle your smoky BBQ sauce all over and put the tray in the oven for an initial 10 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, combine your white wine vinegar and 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil in a bowl with a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your dressing

After 10 min, remove the chicken tray from the oven and sprinkle over the grated cheese

Return the tray to the oven for 5 min further or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the cheese has melted – this is your cheesy BBQ chicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, chop your tomato[es] into wedges, then slice your cucumber into rounds

Wash your baby leaf salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Once everything is almost ready, add the baby leaf salad, chopped tomato and cucumber rounds to the bowl of dressing and give everything a gentle mix</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the cheesy BBQ chicken with the chips and salad to the side

Enjoy!
