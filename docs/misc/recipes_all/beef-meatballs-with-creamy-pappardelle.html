<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Peel and finely chop your shallot[s] and garlic

Zest your lemon[s] and chop your dill finely, including the stalks

Combine your beef mince in a large bowl with the lemon zest, your soy sauce, half the chopped shallot[s], garlic and dill (you'll use the rest later!)

Season with a grind of black pepper, give everything a good mix up and shape into 3 meatballs per person</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat and boil a kettle

Once hot, add the meatballs to the pan and cook for 2 min on each side or until browned

Once the meatballs have browned, transfer them to a plate and set aside, these will finish cooking in the sauce later (reserve the pan!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pan (and any oil) to a medium-high heat and once hot, add the remaining chopped shallot

Cook for 1-2 min or until softened

Meanwhile, dissolve your beef stock mix in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> boiled water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the shallot has softened, add the remaining chopped garlic and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> flour and cook for 30 secs, then add the beef stock mix and your soft cheese to the pan and bring to a boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium-high then add the browned meatballs and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until the meatballs are cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add your linguine to a pot of plenty of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the linguine for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain and return to the pot, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Wash your spinach and pat dry with kitchen paper

Once the meatballs are cooked through, add the spinach to the pan and cook for a further 2 min or until wilted</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the drained linguine and half the grated Italian hard cheese to the pan with the juice of half your lemon[s] and a generous grind of black pepper

Give everything a good mix up until the pasta is fully coated in sauce – these are your beef meatballs with creamy linguine

Tip: Add a splash of the reserved starchy pasta water if your sauce is looking a little dry!

Cut the remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the beef meatballs with creamy linguine

Top with the remaining chopped dill, remaining grated Italian hard cheese and a lemon wedge

Season with a generous grind of black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
