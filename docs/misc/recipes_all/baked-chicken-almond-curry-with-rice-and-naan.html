<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Heat a large, wide-based hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat and boil a kettle

Once hot, add your diced chicken thigh to the dish with 1 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [1 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour and cook for 2 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and dice

Chop your tomato[es] into wedges

Peel and cut your brown onion[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>into wedges

Add the diced pepper to the dish with the tomato and onion wedges</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add your garam masala with your curry powder, ground turmeric, ground smoked paprika, chicken stock mix and ground almonds

Give everything a good mix up and add 250ml <span class="text-purple">[325ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> boiled water with a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Bring to the boil then put the dish in the oven and cook, covered, for 45 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the sauce has thickened – this is your baked chicken & almond curry</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the curry has had 20 min, reboil the kettle

Add your white long grain rice to an oven-proof dish with 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> boiled water

Cover tightly with tin foil and put the dish in the oven for 30 min or until all the water is absorbed and the rice is cooked – this is your baked rice</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the curry is ready, remove the dish from the oven and stir through your natural yoghurt

Leave to stand for 5 min before serving (this helps the flavours to develop) – this is your baked chicken & almond curry

Meanwhile, add your garlic & coriander naan[s] to a toaster for 1-2 min or until warmed through</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the baked chicken & almond curry with the baked rice and warmed naan to the side

Season with a generous pinch of pepper
