<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the potatoes are cooking, trim your green beans then chop in half

Zest your lemon[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>(try to grate lightly with a micro-plane or sharp box grater and avoid grating the white pith, as this is very bitter!)

Cut the lemon[s] in half

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s] finely

Chop your parsley finely, including the stalks</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>

Once tender, drain and leave in the colander to steam dry</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, heat a wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your smoked basa fillet[s] and cook for 3-4 min on each side or until cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

Cut the remaining lemon into 1 wedge per person</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the cooked smoked basa over the warm green bean & potato salad with a lemon wedge to the side

Season the fish with a grind of black pepper and sprinkle over the lemon zest

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
