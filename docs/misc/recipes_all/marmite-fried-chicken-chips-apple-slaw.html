<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into thin chips

Add the chips to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray in the oven for 25-30 min or until golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add a handful of flour to a plate with a generous pinch of salt

Combine your natural yoghurt and most of your Marmite (save a little for the mayo!) in a separate bowl – this is your speedy Marmite buttermilk</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add your cornflour to a large plate with the cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), dried oregano, ground allspice, ground paprika and 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> flour

Add a generous pinch of salt and a few grinds of black pepper and give it a good mix up – this is your spice mix</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Coat the chicken breast strips in the flour, tap off the excess, then add them into the speedy Marmite buttermilk and finally press them into the spice mix firmly to evenly coat all over – these are your Marmite coated chicken strips</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil (enough to cover the base of the pan) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the Marmite coated chicken strips and cook for 5-7 min on each side or until the chicken is crispy and cooked through (no pink meat!) – these are your Marmite fried chicken strips</p><br><br>

Gently mix it all together – this is your slaw</p><br><br>
