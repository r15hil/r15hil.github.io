<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Slice the green chilli<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> finely

Add the sliced chilli (can't handle the heat? Remove the seeds!) to a small bowl with half the cider vinegar (you'll use the rest later!), a small pinch of salt and 1/2 tsp <span class="text-danger">[1 tsp]</span> sugar

Mix everything together and set aside – this is your quick-pickled chilli</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Trim the green stalks off the aubergines and cut each aubergine, lengthways into 6 <span class="text-danger">[12] </span>wedges

Thread 6 aubergine wedges onto 2 skewers, alternating between flesh and skin side up until you have a rack of aubergine

Repeat with the remaining aubergine wedges and remaining skewers until you end up with 2 <span class="text-danger">[4]</span> aubergine racks</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add the aubergine racks to a baking paper-lined baking tray (or two!) with a generous drizzle of olive oil

Season with a pinch of salt and put the tray<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in the oven for an initial 18-20 min or until the aubergine is golden and softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the aubergine racks are in the oven, cut the potatoes (skins on) into wedges

Add the wedges to a separate baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden

Boil half a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Combine the tomato ketchup with the<span class="text-danger"> </span>cayenne pepper (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!), the agave, half the smoked paprika and half the tomato paste (save the rest for later!)

Add the remaining cider vinegar with the smoked sea salt flakes and give everything a good mix up – this is your Kansas-style sauce

Drain and rinse the cannellini beans</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>After an initial 18-20 min, remove the aubergine racks from the oven and pour over half of the Kansas-style sauce (save the rest for later!), spreading the sauce out evenly with the back of a spoon (or cooking brush!)

Return the racks to the oven for a final 5-6 min or until sticky – these are your Kansas-style aubergine ribs</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Heat a medium sized pot over a medium heat with a little drizzle of olive oil, and once hot add the drained cannellini beans with the remaining smoked paprika and remaining tomato paste and cook for 1 min

Add 100ml <span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> boiled water to the pot with the vegetable stock mix, the pickling liquid from the green chillies and 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar

Cook for 4-5 min or until the sauce has slightly thickened – these are your spicy BBQ beans</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Loosen the remaining Kansas-style sauce with 1 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp]</span> cold water

Serve the Kansas-style aubergine ribs with the spicy BBQ beans, wedges and mayo to the side

Sprinkle the quick-pickled green chilli over the wedges and add the Kansas-style sauce to a little pot for dipping

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
