<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot add your salmon fillet[s], skin-side down, season with a pinch of salt and cook for 9-10 min, turning once halfway, or until cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, add the spinach and cook for 1 min, stirring frequently, or until just starting to wilt

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Add the salad to a bowl along with a little olive oil and a squeeze of lemon juice– this is your salad</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the spinach has wilted, add your grated Italian hard cheese and the juice of half your lemon wedges and give everything a good mix up

Season with a good grind of black pepper – this is your spinach & lemon gnocchi</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the cooked salmon over the spinach & lemon gnocchi with the salad to the side

Garnish with the remaining lemon wedges

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
