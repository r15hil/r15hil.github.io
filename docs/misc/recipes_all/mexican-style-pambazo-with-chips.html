<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Cut half of your potatoes (skins on) into chips

Chop the remaining potato[es] (skins on) into small cubes

Add the chips to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of olive oil and a small pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the potato cubes and diced chorizo to the pan with a splash of cold water and cook, covered, for an initial 6-7 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and slice half your red onion[s] as finely as you can

Dice the remaining onion

Combine your white wine vinegar and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>sugar in a bowl with a small pinch of salt and 1 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> [2 tbsp]</span> boiled water and mix it all together

Add the sliced onion to the bowl and set aside – this is your quick-pickled onion</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add the soaked ancho chilli (can’t handle the heat? Go easy!) and all of the soaking liquid to a food processor with your tomato paste and blitz until smooth – this is your pambazo sauce

Once the potato has had an initial 6-7 min, add the diced onion and dried oregano with 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar and cook for 7-8 min or until the potato is cooked through

Once cooked through, add 2/3 of the pambazo sauce (save the rest for later!) and cook for 1-2 min further or until fragrant – this is your pambazo filling</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Slice your brioche bun[s] in half

Brush the brioche lid[s] with the remaining pambazo sauce

Add the brioche halves to a baking tray (or two!), then put the tray[s] in the oven for 4-5 min or until warmed through</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Wash your lettuce, then pat dry with kitchen paper and roughly shred

Crumble your feta into a bowl

Add your mayo to the bowl with a splash of cold water and give everything a good mix up – this is your feta mayo

Drain the quick-pickled onion (save the pickling liquid!)</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To assemble, fill each warmed brioche bun with a little shredded lettuce, the pambazo filling, quick-pickled onion and a dollop of feta mayo – this is your Mexican-style pambazo

Serve the chips and remaining shredded lettuce to the side with the reserved pickling liquid drizzled over the top

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
