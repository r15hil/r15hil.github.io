<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with tin foil</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas and boil a kettle

Heat a large, hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your Fable pulled mushrooms and cook for 2-3 min or until starting to brown</p><br><br>

<p>Meanwhile, top, tail, peel and slice your carrot[s] into discs on the diagonal

Peel and chop your brown onion[s] into wedges</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Season with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> sugar and a small pinch of salt and add 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[550ml] </span>boiled water

Stir everything together and bring to the boil, then cover and put in the oven for 25-30 min or until the sauce has thickened – this is your baked Korean-style BBQ Fable mushrooms</p><br><br>

Cover tightly with tin foil and put the dish in the oven for 30 min or until all the water is absorbed and the rice is cooked – this is your baked rice</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Reboil a kettle

Wash your spinach then add to a colander and pour boiled water all over it so that it starts to wilt

Rinse the wilted spinach under cold running water until it's cool

Once cool, squeeze as much water out of the spinach as you can, add the wilted spinach to a bowl with a pinch of salt and your toasted sesame oil – this is your sesame spinach</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the baked Korean-style BBQ Fable mushrooms, sesame spinach and baked rice

Garnish with your toasted sesame seeds

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
