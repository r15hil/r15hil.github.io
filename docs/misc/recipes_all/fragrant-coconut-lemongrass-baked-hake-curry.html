<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a kettle

Peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

Bash your lemongrass stalk with a rolling pin</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the sliced onion, pepper strips, bashed lemongrass stalk and star anise to a deep baking tray (or oven-proof dish) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Put the tray in the oven for an initial 5-10 min or until the onion has started to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Dissolve the chopped creamed coconut, vegetable stock mix, ground paprika, Thai red curry paste, and a pinch<span class="text-danger"> </span>of<span class="text-danger"> </span>sugar in 500ml <span class="text-purple">[650ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[850ml]</span> boiled water – this is your Thai red curry stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the onion has started to soften, pour the Thai red curry stock over the vegetables, then put the tray back in the oven for 10-15 min or until the sauce has started to thicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>While the sauce is thickening, add your basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the sauce has started to thicken, add your hake fillet[s] to the sauce and cook for 12-15 min further or until the fish is cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily

Season to taste with a pinch of salt</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once done, remove the lemongrass stalk, star anise and discard – this is your coconut & lemongrass baked hake curry</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the coconut & lemongrass baked hake curry with the basmati rice to the side

Tip: For fancy presentation, press the rice into small bowls and turn out

Sprinkle over your crispy onions

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
