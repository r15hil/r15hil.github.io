<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a full kettle

Peel and finely chop the brown onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil and a knob of butter over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Chop the leek<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>in half lengthways, then wash thoroughly to remove any grit from between the leaves

Then top, tail and slice finely

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the onion has started to soften, add the chopped leek, garlic and dried oregano

Cook for 5 min further or until the leek has softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the leek has softened, add the arborio rice and cook for 1 min, stirring to coat the grains in the oil

Add the vegetable stock a ladle at a time, stirring continuously for 20-25 min or until most of the stock is absorbed and the rice is almost cooked

Grate the brie coarsely (or roughly chop into small cubes)

Roughly chop the dried cranberries</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Whilst the rice is cooking, bash the pecans with a rolling pin into small pieces (keep them in the bag so you don't lose any!)

Add the crushed pecans to a baking tray lined with non-stick baking paper and drizzle over half of the honey (you'll use the rest later!)

Put the tray in the oven for 3 min or until golden and crunchy – these are your honey roasted pecans

Tip: Watch them like a hawk so they don't burn!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the rice is almost cooked, add the grated brie, half <span class="text-danger">[all] </span>the wholegrain mustard and a generous pinch of salt and pepper to the pan

Tip: Cooking for 2? Save the rest of the wholegrain mustard for another recipe!

Cook for 2-3 min further or until the rice is cooked with a slight bite – this is your brie & leek risotto

Wash the rocket, then pat it dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the brie & leek risotto topped with the honey roasted pecans and chopped cranberries

Garnish with the rocket and drizzle over the remaining honey

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
