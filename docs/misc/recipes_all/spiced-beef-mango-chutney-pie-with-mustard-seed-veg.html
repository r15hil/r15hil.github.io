<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the onion and carrot is starting to soften, turn the heat up to high, then add your beef mince to the pan and cook for 3-4 min or until browned all over, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

Once browned, add the chopped garlic, remaining turmeric, curry powder, mango chutney and 1 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour and cook for 1-2 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add your beef stock mix, soy sauce, half the chopped coriander (save the rest for garnish!) and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> boiled water and reduce the heat to medium-high, then cook for 3-4 min further or until the sauce has thickened

Once thickened, season with a generous grind of black pepper and transfer to an oven-proof dish (cooking for 2 or more? Use individual dishes for fancy presentation!) – this is your pie mix</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Dust your work surface generously with flour, unwrap your puff pastry, roll it out to approx. 0.5cm thickness with a rolling pin and cut to the size of your pie dish[es], then lay it over the dish[es], trim off any excess (use for fancy pie decorations!) and press the edges with a fork to seal the pastry to the dish[es]

Brush with a little water, add a few black mustard seeds to the top (you’ll use the rest later!), then put in the oven for 15-20 min or until puffed up, golden and cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your spiced beef & mango chutney pie</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>After the initial 20-25 min, remove the tray[s] with the chopped vegetables from the oven, add a drizzle of vegetable oil and the remaining black mustard seeds and give everything a good mix up

Return the tray[s] to the oven for a final 5 min – this is your mustard seed veg</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the spiced beef & mango chutney pie with the mustard seed veg topped with the remaining chopped coriander to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
