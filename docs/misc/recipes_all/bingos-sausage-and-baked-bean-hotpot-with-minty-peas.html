<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a kettle

Slice your potatoes (skins on) into thin discs

Add the sliced potatoes to a heatproof bowl, then cover the bowl with cling film and pierce a few holes in the top with a fork

Put the bowl in the microwave for 6-8 min or until the potatoes are fork-tender</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid, with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, use scissors to chop your sausages into thirds into the dish and cook for 5-6 min or until beginning to brown</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Peel and chop (or grate) your garlic

Peel and finely dice your red onion[s]

Strip your mint leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems

Tip: Hold the top of the herb sprigs firmly and slide your fingers down their lengths to easily remove the leaves

Drain and rinse your cannellini beans</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Top the sausage and bean filling with the sliced potatoes and sprinkle over your dried thyme

Put the dish in the oven, lid off, for 20-25 min or until the potatoes and sausages are cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your hearty sausage & baked bean hotpot

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>When the hotpot is almost ready, reboil a kettle

Add your blanched peas to a pot, cover them with boiling water (just enough to cover them), bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 1 min or until they're warmed through

Once ready, drain and return to the pot, then stir through a small knob of butter with the chopped mint

<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the hearty sausage & baked bean hotpot with the minty peas to the side

Season with a generous grind of black pepper
