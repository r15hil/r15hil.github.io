<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, boil half a kettle

Peel and finely chop your brown onion[s]

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) your ginger

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, wash your spinach, then add to a colander and pour boiled water all over it so that it starts to wilt

Rinse the wilted spinach under cold running water until it's cool

Once cool, squeeze the water out of the spinach

Once the curry has thickened, add the wilted spinach and the juice of half your lime[s] – this is your creamy chickpea curry</p><br><br>
