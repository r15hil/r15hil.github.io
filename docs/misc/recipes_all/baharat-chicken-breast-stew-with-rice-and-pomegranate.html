<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air, then boil a kettle

Peel and finely slice your brown onion[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Dissolve your chicken stock mix in 225ml <span class="text-purple">[330ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> boiled water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your diced chicken breast with a generous pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until lightly browned</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and a pinch of salt bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the chicken has browned, add the sliced onion to the pan and cook for 2-3 min or until softened

Once softened, reduce the heat to medium-high, then add the chopped garlic with your ground turmeric, baharat and 1/2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1 tbsp] </span>flour and cook for a further 1 min or until fragrant

Tip: Add a drizzle more oil if your pan is looking a little dry!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, add the chicken stock to the pan with a pinch of sugar and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 6-8 min or until the sauce has thickened and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your baharat chicken stew</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Whilst the stew is cooking, cut the top and bottom off your pomegranate[s] then slice into quarters, then place the pomegranate quarters into a large bowl filled with cold water

Tip: This helps prevent mess and makes separating the pith easier!

Separate the pomegranate seeds from the white pith and discard the pith, then drain the pomegranate seeds in a fine sieve and set them aside for garnish</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Combine your cider vinegar with 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper in a bowl – this is your dressing

Wash your baby leaf salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Combine the baby leaf salad in the bowl of dressing and give everything a good mix up – this is your dressed salad</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the baharat chicken stew over the cooked rice with the dressed salad to the side

Scatter the pomegranate seeds all over

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
