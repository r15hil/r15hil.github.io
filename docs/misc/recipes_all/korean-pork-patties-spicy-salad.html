<p><strong>Description:</strong> These Korean pork patties are inspired by tteok-galbi, small oblong beauties flavoured with miso and onion and cooked in a sweet, sticky sauce. We've served this with fragrant basmati rice and a kimchi-inspired spicy salad. Seoul food! (Dairy-free: see our FAQs for details).</p>
