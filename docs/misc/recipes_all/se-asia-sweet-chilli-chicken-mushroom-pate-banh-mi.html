<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Transfer the cooked chicken to a clean board (reserve the tray!) and shred apart using two forks – this is your pulled chicken

Combine your red chilli relish and pulled chicken with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and mix until well coated – this is your sweet chilli chicken

Discard the tin foil from the reserved tray, then add your baguette[s] and put the tray in the oven for 2-3 min or until warmed through and crusty</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Slice each warmed baguette in half (without cutting all the way through) and open it out like a book

Spread over the mushroom pâté and top with the sweet chilli chicken, carrot ribbons, cucumber slices and reserved mint & coriander leaves – this is your sweet chilli chicken & mushroom báhn mì

Serve the pickled salad and sriracha mayo to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
