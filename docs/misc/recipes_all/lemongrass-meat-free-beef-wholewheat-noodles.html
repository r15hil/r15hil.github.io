<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chopped coriander stalks and outer lemongrass layers and cook for 2-3 min or until fragrant
