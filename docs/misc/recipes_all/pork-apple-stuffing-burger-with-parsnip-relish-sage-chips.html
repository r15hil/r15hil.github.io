<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6

Top, tail, peel and grate your parsnip[s], then peel and slice your shallot[s] finely

Add the grated parsnip and sliced shallot to a pot with a lid with 2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tsp] </span>sugar and 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> cold water and cook, covered, over a medium heat for an initial 25-30 min or until the parsnip has softened and the water has evaporated – this is your caramelised parsnip</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Boil half a kettle

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into thick chips and add them to a baking paper-lined tray (or two!) with a small drizzle of vegetable oil

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and sprinkle over half your dried sage (save the rest for later!)

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 25-30 min or until golden and crisp – these are your sage chips</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Grate your apple[s] (skin on) and discard the core[s]

Add your dried cranberries to a small bowl and cover with boiled water, then set aside to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add your pork mince (remove the paper if required!) and the remaining dried sage to a bowl with your panko breadcrumbs and grated apple

Season with salt and pepper and mix thoroughly until fully combined (clean hands is the best way!) – this is your pork & apple stuffing mixture

Shape the pork & apple stuffing mixture into 1<span class="text-danger"> </span>burger patty per person</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the patty[ies], press them down firmly with a spatula and cook for 5 min

Reduce the heat to medium-high, flip each patty and cook for a further 5 min or until browned and cooked through (no pink meat!) – this your pork & apple stuffing patty</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the caramelised parsnip has softened, add a small knob of butter with half your cider vinegar (you'll use the rest later!) and a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up – this is your parsnip relish

Wash your lettuce and pat dry with kitchen paper, then separate 1 whole outer leaf per person and cut the remaining lettuce into quarters, lengthways</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Slice your brioche bun[s] in half and add them to a baking tray, cut side up, then put the tray in the oven for 4-5 min or until warmed through

Combine your mayo and cranberry sauce in a small bowl – this is your cranberry mayo

Drain the softened cranberries, then roughly chop and add them to a bowl with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>olive oil, the remaining cider vinegar and a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your cranberry vinaigrette</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To build, spread most of the cranberry mayo over the toasted brioche base, add a lettuce leaf, a pork & apple stuffing patty, the parsnip relish and top with a toasted brioche lid – this is your pork & apple stuffing burger with parsnip relish

Drizzle the cranberry vinaigrette over the lettuce quarters, then serve the sage chips and any remaining cranberry mayo to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
