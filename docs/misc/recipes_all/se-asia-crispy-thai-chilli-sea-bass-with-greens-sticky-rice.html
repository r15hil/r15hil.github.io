<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ gas 6, boil half a kettle then bash your lemongrass with a rolling pin, remove the tough outer layers and set aside the soft inner core[s]

Rinse your sushi rice in a sieve under cold running water for 30 secs, then add to an oven-proof dish with the outer lemongrass layers and 250ml <span class="text-purple">[325ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[500ml]</span> boiled water, cover with tin foil and put the dish in the oven for 25 min or until all the water is absorbed and the rice is cooked</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Chop the softer inner lemongrass core[s] finely

Slice half your red chilli[es] into rounds and finely chop the remaining chilli

Slice half your shallot[s] and finely dice the remaining shallot

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Trim, then slice your spring onion[s]</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 2 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [3 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp] </span>vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped lemongrass, half of the chopped garlic (you'll use the rest later!), chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and diced shallot

Cook for 3-4 min or until starting to brown</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once browned, add to a bowl with your fish sauce and 1 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> sugar and give everything a good mix up until fully combined (reserve the pan!) – this is your pla rad prik sauce

Wash your spring greens then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Rip the leaves off your spring greens, discard the tough stalks, then layer the leaves over each other, roll them up and slice into thin strips

Trim your green beans</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add the sliced spring greens, trimmed green beans, sliced shallot, remaining chopped garlic and chilli rounds (not a fan of spice? Just add a little) to a large piece of tin foil (or two!) with a generous splash of cold water and your soy sauce, then scrunch the foil around the spring greens to form a tightly sealed parcel and add to a baking tray

Tip: Cooking for 3 or more? Make 2 separate parcels!

Put the tray in the oven for 10-12 min or until the spring greens are tender – these are your soy greens</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Pat your sea bass fillet[s] dry with kitchen paper

Sprinkle your cornflour all over and rub it into both sides of the fish until fully coated, then set aside for later – this is your coated sea bass</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pan to a high heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil

Once hot, add the coated sea bass, skin side down, and cook for 5 min, then turn and cook for 1 min further until cooked through – this is your crispy Thai-style sea bass

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the crispy Thai-style sea bass with the sticky rice (discard the lemongrass!) and soy greens to the side

Spoon over the pla rad prik sauce

Top with the sliced spring onion and your crispy onions

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
