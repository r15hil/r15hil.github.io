Meanwhile, dissolve the chopped creamed coconut, chicken stock mix and fish sauce in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[400ml] </span>boiled water – this is your coconut stock</p><br><br>

Chop the remaining lime into 1 wedge per person</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Thai-style yellow chicken curry over the cooked rice

Garnish with the chilli rounds (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and a lime wedge
