<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook your food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once the pan is hot, add your basa fillet[s] along with your soy sauce and the juice of half your lemon[s]</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Sprinkle your ground smoked paprika over the fish and cook for 3-4 min on each side or until cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the fish is cooking, roughly dice your tomato[es]

Chop half your cucumber (you'll use the rest later!) into small, bite-sized pieces and chop your parsley roughly, including the stalks

Add the diced tomato, chopped cucumber and half of the chopped parsley to a bowl with half your ground sumac (save the rest for later!), a pinch of salt and pepper and a drizzle of olive oil and give everything a good mix up – this is your Greek-style salad</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add your naan[s] to a toaster for 1-2 min or until warmed through</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, cut the remaining cucumber in half lengthways, scrape out the inner seeds with a teaspoon and discard

Grate the deseeded cucumber and squeeze out any excess water

Add your mayo to a bowl along with the grated cucumber, the juice of the remaining lemon, the remaining ground sumac and a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your tzatziki mayo</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the fish is cooked, remove from the heat and break it apart into large, bite-sized pieces – this is your Mediterranean-style basa

Wash your lettuce, then pat it dry with kitchen paper and roughly shred

Dress the shredded lettuce with a drizzle of olive oil</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Load up a warmed naan with the Greek-style salad and Mediterranean-style basa – this is your Mediterranean-style basa gyro

Dollop over the tzatziki mayo and garnish with the remaining chopped parsley

Serve the dressed shredded lettuce to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
