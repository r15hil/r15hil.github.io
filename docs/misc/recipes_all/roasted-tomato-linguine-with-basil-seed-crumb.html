<h4>Step 2</h4>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the onion has softened, add your tomato paste and sliced garlic to the pan and cook for 3-4 min or until the garlic has softened

Once the garlic has softened, add the vegetable stock, roasted tomatoes (reserve the tray for later!), balsamic vinegar and 2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tsp]</span> sugar

Add your panko breadcrumbs and pine kernel & seed mix to the reserved tray with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper and stir it all together

Put the tray in the oven for 3-5 min or until everything is golden and crisp – this is your pine kernel & seed pangrattato

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, roughly chop your basil, including the stalks

Add the roasted tomato sauce to the drained linguine with a splash of the reserved starchy pasta water and give everything a good mix up – this is your roasted tomato linguine

Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the roasted tomato linguine with the salad to the side

Drizzle the salad with olive oil and a pinch of salt

Sprinkle the pine kernel & seed pangrattato over the roasted tomato linguine and garnish with the chopped basil

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
