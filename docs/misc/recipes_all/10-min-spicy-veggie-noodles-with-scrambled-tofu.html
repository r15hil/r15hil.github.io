<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now let's get started!

Boil a kettle and heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Drain your tofu, pat it dry with kitchen paper and crumble it into bite-sized pieces

Chop your Tenderstem broccoli in half</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once the pan is hot, add the crumbled tofu with a generous pinch of salt and cook for 5-6 min or until golden and crispy

Tip: Add a little more vegetable oil if the pan is looking dry

Add your wholewheat noodles and the Tenderstem broccoli to a pot with plenty of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat for 4-5 min or until cooked with a bite</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Trim, then slice your spring onion[s] roughly

Once the crumbled tofu is golden, add your ginger & garlic paste to the pan and cook for a further 1-2 min or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Combine your soy sauce, chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), red chilli relish and the juice of your lime[s] in a bowl – this is your spicy noodle sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once cooked, drain the wholewheat noodles and Tenderstem broccoli and reserve a cup of the starchy noodle water

Crush your roasted peanuts with a rolling pin

Tip: If you don’t have a rolling pin, just chop them roughly!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Stir the drained wholewheat noodles and Tenderstem broccoli through the crumbled tofu with a pinch of salt

Add your spicy noodle sauce with a splash of the reserved noodle water and give everything a good mix up – these are your spicy veggie noodles

Tip: Add a little more of the reserved noodle water if it's looking dry</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the spicy veggie noodles and drizzle your sriracha (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) all over the top

Garnish with the roasted peanuts and sliced spring onion

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
