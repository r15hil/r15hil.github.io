<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat, once hot, add your chicken breast portions with a pinch of salt and cook for 3 min on each side or until golden</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add a couple of splashes of water to the pan and cover with a lid

Cook for a further 12-15 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)

Once cooked through, transfer the chicken to a plate and reserve the pan

Dissolve your chicken stock mix in 250ml <span class="text-purple">[325ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[425ml] </span>boiled water – this is your chicken stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, cut your sweet potato[es] (skins on) into fries

Add the fries to a large baking tray (or two!) with your ground paprika, a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until the fries are golden and crispy</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Melt 20g <span class="text-purple">[30g]</span> <span class="text-danger">[40g] </span>butter in a pot over a medium heat, once melted, add 20g <span class="text-purple">[30g]</span> <span class="text-danger">[40g]</span> flour and stir with a wooden spoon for 1-2 min or until a sandy paste forms — this is your roux

Gradually whisk the chicken stock in a little at a time, and cook for 5 min or until a smooth, thick sauce remains

Stir your Henderson's Relish through the sauce — this is your gravy</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, wash, then rip the leaves off your spring greens, discard the tough stalks, then layer the leaves over each other, roll them up and slice into thin strips

Heat the reserved pan with a knob of butter over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced spring greens and cook for 3-4 min or until tender with a bite

Season with a pinch of salt – these are your buttered greens</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Drain your mozzarella, then pat and squeeze as much liquid out as you can with kitchen paper

Chop the mozzarella into small pieces

Once the sweet potato fries are cooked, push them apart to form 1 pile per person on the tray, then add the chopped mozzarella to each pile and return to the oven for 4-5 min or until the cheese has melted – these are your cheesy sweet potato fries

Tip: Cooking for 3 or more? You may need to do this in 2 batches!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Shred the chicken apart using two forks – this technique is known as ‘pulling’

Add the pulled chicken to the gravy, increase the heat to medium-high and cook for 1-2 min or until everything’s hot</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the pulled chicken & gravy over the cheesy sweet potato fries, with the buttered greens to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
