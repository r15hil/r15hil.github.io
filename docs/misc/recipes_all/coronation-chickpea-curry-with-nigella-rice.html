<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [600ml] </span>cold water to the pot and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving – this is your nigella rice</p><br><br>

<p>Add the mango stock and chopped green beans and cook for a further 5-6 min or until the stock has reduced by half

Remove the pan from the heat and stir in your natural yoghurt and chopped coriander

Taste and season with more salt and pepper if needed – this is your coronation chickpea curry

Fluff the nigella rice with a fork</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the coronation chickpea curry over the nigella rice and garnish with the reserved coriander leaves

Sprinkle over your flaked almonds
