<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then slice your aubergine[s] in half lengthways, keeping the green stalks on

Score the flesh in a criss-cross pattern, then add the aubergine halves to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of olive oil and and a pinch of salt

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until the flesh has softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Combine your shredded red cabbage, cider vinegar, a pinch of salt and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> sugar in a bowl and mix well, then set aside to pickle – this is your quick-pickled red cabbage

Once the aubergine has been cooking for 15 min, peel and finely slice your red onion[s]

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once the pan is hot, add most of the sliced onion (save the rest for garnish!) with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until starting to caramelise</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Chop your coriander finely, including the stalks

Add the smashed avocado, chopped coriander and juice of half your lime[s] (you'll use the rest later!) to a bowl with a pinch of salt and gently mix – this is your avo salsa</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the aubergine is tender, scoop the softened flesh out of the skins with a spoon – this is your pulled aubergine

Tip: Carefully hold the stalks (they will be hot!) to scrape the flesh out easily

Discard the skins</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the onion has started to caramelise, add the chopped garlic and ground smoked paprika and cook for 2 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the pulled aubergine, agave, soy sauce, BBQ sauce and a generous grind of black pepper to the pan then cook for 2-3 min until everything's combined – this your smoky pulled aubergine</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add your tortillas to a baking tray and put the tray in the oven for 2-3 min or until warmed through

Drain the quick-pickled red cabbage, discard the liquid

Slice the remaining lime into wedges</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Divide the smoky pulled aubergine evenly between the warmed tortillas

Top with the avo salsa and quick-pickled red cabbage

Garnish with the remaining sliced onion and lime wedges

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
