<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a full kettle

Peel and chop your potatoes into rough, bite-sized pieces, then add to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a generous pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your diced chorizo and cook for 6-8 min or until starting to crisp

Whilst the chorizo is crisping, trim, then chop your spring onion[s]</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once the potatoes are done, drain them and return to the pot to steam dry

Mash the potatoes until smooth

Add half the cooked chorizo (reserve the pan, remaining chorizo and any oil for later), chopped spring onion and a pinch of<span class="text-danger"> </span>salt and pepper and give it a good mix up – this is your chorizo & potato mixture</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Shape the chorizo & potato mixture into 2 cakes per person

Add the chorizo potato cakes to a lightly oiled baking tray

Put the tray in the oven for 12-15 min or until golden

Tip: If the potato cake mix is a little wet and not sticking together nicely, add a spoonful or two of flour</p><br><br>

Top with a fried egg and the crispy chorizo

Garnish with the chopped chives

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
