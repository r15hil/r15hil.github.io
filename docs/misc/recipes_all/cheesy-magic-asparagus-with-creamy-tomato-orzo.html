<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium heat

Once hot, add your pine nuts and cook for 2-3 min or until toasted and lightly golden

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don’t burn!

Once golden, transfer the pine nuts to a bowl and reserve the pan</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add the stock to the pan and bring to the boil over a high heat

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>When the orzo has 7 min left, heat a separate, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the trimmed asparagus and cook for an initial 3 min, then sprinkle over 2/3 of the grated cheese and cook for a further 3 min or until the cheese has melted and begun to crisp up on the bottom – this is your cheesy asparagus

Once the orzo is cooked, stir through your soft cheese and the remaining grated cheese and cook for a final 2-3 min – this is your creamy tomato orzo</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the creamy tomato orzo in a bowl with the cheesy asparagus to the side (crispy side up)

Top with the toasted pine nuts and a generous grind of black pepper

<span class="text-danger">Tip: Cooking for kids? Leave the pine nuts and black pepper!</span>

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
