<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based, hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Top, tail and chop your carrot[s] into rounds</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once the casserole dish is hot, add your lean beef mince with a pinch of salt

Crumble your chestnut mushrooms roughly into the pan with your hands</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add the carrot rounds to the dish with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span><span class="text-danger"> [2 tbsp]</span> flour and give everything a good mix

Add in your beef stock mix with your tomato paste, Henderson's Relish and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[450ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml] </span>boiled water

Stir through your Marmite and bring to the boil over a high heat – this is your pie filling</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, slice your potato[es] (skins on) into discs

Carefully arrange the potato discs over the top of the pie filling

Season with a pinch of salt and put the dish in the oven for 35-40 min or until everything’s bubbling, the potatoes are cooked and the beef is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your all-in-one hearty beef & mushroom pie</p><br><br>

<p>Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>When the pie has 15 min left, add your Tenderstem broccoli to a large piece of tin foil (or two!) with a pinch of salt, 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>cold water and a large knob of butter

Scrunch the foil around your Tenderstem broccoli to form a tightly sealed parcel[s] and add to a baking tray

Put the tray in the oven for 10-12 min or until the Tenderstem broccoli is tender</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Season the all-in-one hearty lean beef & mushroom pie with a grind of pepper and serve the Tenderstem broccoli to the side
