<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your pork mince (remove the paper if required!) with a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until beginning to brown, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

Whilst the pork is cooking, dissolve your beef stock mix, red wine paste and tomato paste in 150ml <span class="text-purple">[225ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[300ml]</span> boiled water – this is your red wine stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once the pork has browned, reduce the heat to medium-high, add the chopped shallot and cook for a further 2-3 min or until softened

Once softened, add the chopped garlic with your fennel seeds and cook for 1 min or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add your tortiglioni to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the tortiglioni for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water</p><br><br>

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 7-8 min or until thickened and the pork is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your pork, fennel & red wine ragu</p><br><br>
