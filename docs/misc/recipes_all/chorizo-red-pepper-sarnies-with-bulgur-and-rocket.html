<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a kettle

Cut the red pepper<span class="text-danger">[s]</span> in half (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and chop each half in half again so that you are left with 4<span class="text-danger"> [8] </span>pieces

Add the pepper quarters to a baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil and put the tray in the oven for an initial 18 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the bulgur wheat to a pot with plenty of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cook for 7 min or until tender with a bite, then drain and set aside to steam dry</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Chop the basil finely, including the stalks and set aside for later

Dice the tomato<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> finely

Add the diced tomato to a large bowl with the juice of 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> lemon, a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the diced chorizo and cook for 3-4 min or until golden and crisp, then remove the pan from the heat and set aside – this is your crispy chorizo</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Combine the juice of the remaining lemon with 2 tbsp<span class="text-danger"> [4 tbsp] </span>olive oil and a pinch of salt and sugar – this is your lemon dressing

Cut the ciabatta in half

Chop the green beans into small bite-sized pieces</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the pepper has been roasting for 18 min, remove the tray from the oven and add the chopped green beans to the tray

Mix the beans into any oil on the tray

Return the tray to the oven along with the sliced ciabatta and cook for 6-7 min further, or until the beans are tender with bite and the ciabattas are warmed through</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Fluff the cooked bulgur with a fork and add it to the bowl with the diced tomato

Once done, carefully transfer half the roasted pepper quarters (you'll use the rest later!) to a board and chop them finely (it will be hot!)

Add the chopped roasted pepper to the bulgur with the chopped basil and give everything a good stir – this is your roasted pepper bulgur

Wash the rocket, then pat it dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Spread your toasted ciabatta with some mayo, then fill with the crispy chorizo, a handful of rocket and a roasted red pepper quarter – these are your chorizo & red pepper sarnies

Serve the chorizo & red pepper sarnies with the roasted pepper bulgur, any remaining rocket and the roasted green beans to the side

Drizzle the lemon dressing over the rocket and crumble the feta over the bulgur and enjoy!</p><br><br>
