<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the sausages are in the oven, add your waxy potatoes to a pot of plenty of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, cook for 17-18 min or until fork-tender

Once the potatoes are fork tender, drain then return them to the pot and crush gently</p><br><br>
