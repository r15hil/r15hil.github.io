<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Put a large baking tray (or two) in the oven to heat up

Cut your potato[es] (skin on) into wedges, then peel and finely slice your red onion[s]

Slice your chestnut mushrooms finely and chop your smoked streaky bacon roughly</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add a handful of flour to a plate and a splash of milk to a shallow bowl

Add your panko breadcrumbs and half your ground paprika (you'll use the rest later!) to a separate plate with a drizzle of olive oil and mix it all together

Season your chicken breast strips with a generous pinch of salt, coat them in flour, tap off any excess, then add them to the milk and finally press them into the breadcrumbs firmly to coat evenly – these are your breaded chicken dippers</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add the potato wedges to one side of a baking tray with the remaining ground paprika, a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up

Add the breaded chicken dippers to the other side of the baking tray (cooking for 3 or more? Use a separate tray!) and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the wedges are golden – these are your chicken dippers & wedges</p><br><br>

<p>Add your tomato paste to a bowl with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and 3 tbsp<span class="text-purple"> [4 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[6 tbsp]</span> cold water and give everything a good mix up – this is your tomato sauce

Drain your mozzarella, then pat it dry with kitchen paper (squeeze as much liquid out as you can)

Tear the drained mozzarella into rough, bite-sized pieces</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add your pizza base[s] to the heated up baking tray[s]

Top with your sliced pepperoni, sliced onion, sliced mushrooms, chopped bacon and torn mozzarella and season with a pinch of pepper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>While the pizza is cooking, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Combine the chopped garlic (not a big garlic fan? Try using less!) with your mayo, dried oregano and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> cold water in a bowl – this is your garlic & herb dip</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the meaty pizza with the chicken dippers, wedges and garlic & herb dip to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
