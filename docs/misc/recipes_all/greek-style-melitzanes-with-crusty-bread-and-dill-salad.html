<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 240ºC/ 220ºC (fan)/ gas 9

Boil a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Trim the green stalk[s] off your aubergine[s] and slice into thick rounds

Peel and chop your red onion[s] into wedges

Crush your garlic open by squashing with the side of a knife and discard the skin

Wash your lettuce, then pat dry with kitchen paper and roughly chop</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once hot, add the aubergine rounds, onion wedges and crushed garlic to the dish

Add your tomato paste, chopped tomatoes, dried oregano, red wine stock paste, half your red wine vinegar (save the rest for later!) and 350ml <span class="text-purple">[430ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [480ml]</span> boiled water

Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and 1 1/2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[2 1/2 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[3 1/2 tsp]</span> sugar and give everything a good mix up</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Put the dish in the oven, lid off, for 35 min, stirring once halfway until the aubergine has completely softened and the sauce has thickened – this is your Greek-style melitzanes

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>When everything's nearly ready, put your ciabatta[s] in the oven for 5 min or until warmed and crusty</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, chop your dill roughly, including the stalks

Add the remaining red wine vinegar to a bowl with most of the chopped dill (save the rest for garnish!), 2 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[2 1/2 tbsp]<span class="text-danger"> </span>[3 tbsp]</span> olive oil and a pinch of salt and mix together – this is your dill dressing

Add the chopped lettuce to the dressing and toss – this is your dill salad</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Greek-style melitzanes with your Greek cheese crumbled over the top and the dill salad to the side

Tear the ciabatta in half and top with a little butter

Garnish the Greek-style melitzanes with the reserved chopped dill

Dig in!</p><br><br>
