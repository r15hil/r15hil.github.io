<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a full kettle

Slice your aubergine[s] in half lengthways, keeping the green stalk[s] on, then score the flesh in a criss-cross pattern, taking care not to cut through the skin

Add the aubergine halves to a baking tray (or two!) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil and and a generous pinch of salt

Put the tray[s] in the oven for an initial 15 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Whilst the aubergine is cooking, peel and chop your red onion[s] into wedges

Cut your tomato[es] into wedges

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat

Once hot, add your lamb mince and cook for 3-4 min or until browned all over, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, dissolve half your beef stock mix (you'll use the rest later!) and your tomato paste in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[260ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [350ml]</span> boiled water – this is your tomato stock

Add your ground cumin to the lamb with your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and dried oregano and cook for 30 secs

Add the tomato stock with a grind of pepper, reduce the heat to medium-low and cook for 15 min or until thickened and the lamb is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your Turkish-style lamb stew</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the aubergine has had an initial 15 min, remove the tray from the oven and press the flesh down firmly with a fork to release the juices (this will help it cook quicker!)

Add the tomato and onion wedges to the tray[s] with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt

Return the tray[s] to the oven for 15 min further or until the aubergine flesh has softened and everything is tender - these are your roasted vegetables</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Chop your dill finely, including the stalks

Dissolve the remaining beef stock mix in 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> boiled water in a large bowl

Add your couscous to the large bowl with the beef stock, stir it all together, then cover with a tea towel and set aside until all of the stock has been absorbed</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the aubergine is tender, scoop the softened flesh out of the skin, discard the skin

Tip: Carefully hold the stalks (they will be hot!) to scrape the flesh out easily

Chop the scooped aubergine flesh finely</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the chopped aubergine flesh to a bowl with the chopped garlic, your cultured coconut and a pinch of salt

Stir it all together – this is your dairy-free aubergine cultured coconut

Fluff the couscous with a fork</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the dairy-free aubergine cultured coconut over the fluffed couscous, then top with the Turkish-style lamb stew and roasted vegetables

Garnish with the chopped dill and a grind of black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
