<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil half a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based, hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once hot, add your diced chicken breast to the dish along with a very generous pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 2 min or until very lightly browned

Wash your spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Crush your garlic open by squashing with the side of a knife and remove the skin

Crush your cardamom pod[s] open by squashing with the side of a knife

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) your ginger, then chop it in half

Peel and chop your shallot[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>into wedges, then chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the chicken is slightly golden, add the crushed garlic, cardamom pod[s], chopped ginger, shallot wedges and chopped creamed coconut

Add your spinach to the dish along with your basmati rice, ground turmeric, chicken stock mix and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[600ml] </span>boiled water

Give everything a good mix up</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Bring to the boil over a high heat, cover with a lid, then put the dish in the oven for 20-25 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and the rice is tender

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Reboil a kettle

While the chicken is cooking, combine your natural yoghurt and nigella seeds in a small bowl along with a pinch of salt – this is your nigella yoghurt

Add your blanched peas to a colander and pour boiled water all over them to refresh them

Once the chicken is cooked, mix through the refreshed peas – this your one-pot chicken breast & coconut pea-laf</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the one-pot chicken breast & coconut pea-laf with the nigella yoghurt to the side

Tip: Look out for the cardamom pod[s] and ginger pieces and discard them!
