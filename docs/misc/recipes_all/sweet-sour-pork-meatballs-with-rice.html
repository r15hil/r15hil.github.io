<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the rice is cooking, add your pork mince (remove the paper if required!) to a large bowl with a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up until thoroughly combined (clean hands is the best way!)

Divide the pork mixture and shape into 5 small meatballs per person – these are your pork meatballs</p><br><br>

Once hot, add the pork meatballs to the pan and cook for 2 min on each side or until browned

Reduce the heat to medium-high and cook, covered, for a further 6 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>
