<p><strong>Description:</strong> Our Greek inspired bake is somewhere between a ratatouille and a moussaka. You'll roast aubergine and courgette, combine them in a tomato sauce, press them down into a delicous layer, top them with a cheesy home-made b√©chamel sauce and crispy panko breadcrumbs. Served with a fresh side salad. Cosy, comforting and wholesome. </p>
