<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Peel half your red onion[s] (you'll use the rest later!) and slice<span class="text-danger"> </span>into thin rings

Add the onion rings to a bowl with your red wine vinegar and set aside to pickle – this is your quick-pickled onion</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Cut your potatoes (skins on) into chips

Add the chips to a baking tray with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Put the tray in the oven for 30 min or until crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the chips are in the oven, peel and grate the remaining red onion[s]

Add the grated onion, your panko breadcrumbs and lean beef mince to a bowl with a pinch of salt and pepper

Mix thoroughly until fully combined, then shape into 1 lean beef burger patty per person

Add the lean beef burger patty[ies] to a separate, lightly oiled baking tray (or two!) and put the tray[s] in the oven for 15-20 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>

Chop your mint finely, discard the stalks

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Chop your red chilli[es] finely</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add the chopped parsley and mint to a pestle & mortar with a pinch of salt and a small splash of cold water

Grind the mix to a paste, then add your mayo, chopped garlic, chopped red chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and 2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tsp]</span> of your red wine vinegar from the quick-pickled onion – this is your chimichurri mayo

Slice your brioche bun[s] in half</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) (or griddle if you have one), over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the brioche halves, cut-side down, and cook for 3 min or until toasted and charred, then set them aside until serving

Tip: Cooking for 3 or more? Do this is in batches!

Grate your cheddar cheese</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the lean beef burger patty is cooked, remove the tray[s] from the oven and top them with the grated cheese

Return the tray to the oven for 3-4 min or until the cheese has melted – this is your cheesy lean beef burger patty[ies]

Meanwhile, separate your lettuce into leaves, then wash them thoroughly and pat them dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To build, top each toasted brioche base with a few lettuce leaves, a cheesy lean beef burger patty, some quick-pickled onion, a dollop of chimichurri mayo and the toasted brioche lid – this is your cheesy lean beef burger

Serve the chips, any remaining lettuce leaves and remaining chimichurri mayo to the side, then top the lettuce leaves with any remaining quick-pickled onion

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
