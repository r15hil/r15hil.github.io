<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, boil a kettle, then take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Peel the potatoes and chop them into large bite-sized pieces, then add them to one side of a baking paper-lined tray, top them with the soy sauce, rice vinegar, a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Put the tray in the oven for an initial 20 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chicken breast portions with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 3 min on each side or until browned

Once browned, transfer to an oven-proof dish and reserve the pan for later</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the chicken is browning, top, tail and peel the carrots and chop them into batons

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and finely chop (or grate) the ginger

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Slice the red chilli<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> in half lengthways</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Chop the creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Dissolve the chicken stock mix, chopped creamed coconut, tamarind paste and ground turmeric in 300ml <span class="text-danger">[600ml] </span>boiled water

Stir in the lime leaves – this is your coconut stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Return the reserved pan (with any remaining oil) to a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chopped ginger and garlic, chilli halves (can’t handle the heat? Go easy!) and 1 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> flour and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the coconut stock and cook for 2 min or until thickened slightly

Once thickened, transfer to the dish with the chicken and put it in the oven for an initial 15 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>After the initial 20 min, remove the potato tray from the oven and add the carrot batons to the other side with a grind of black pepper

Tip: Cooking for 4? Use 2 trays!

Return the tray<span class="text-danger">[s] </span>to the oven for 20 min further or until crispy and fork-tender – these are your soy roasties and roasted carrots</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Wash the spring greens, then pat them dry with kitchen paper, rip the leaves off the spring greens, discard the tough stalks, then layer the leaves over each other, roll them up and slice into thin strips

Once the chicken has had 15 min, remove the dish from the oven and add the sliced spring greens

Give everything a good mix up and return the dish to the oven for a final 4-5 min or until the greens are wilted and the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Slice the cooked chicken and serve it over the wilted greens with the soy roasties and roast carrots to the side

Spoon the ginger & coconut sauce from the dish all over

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
