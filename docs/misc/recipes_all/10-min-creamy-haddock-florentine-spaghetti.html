<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Boil a full kettle

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Chop the cherry tomatoes in half</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Wash the spinach

Once hot, add the roasted garlic paste, halved cherry tomatoes and spinach to the pan and cook for 2 min or until the spinach has wilted

Meanwhile, dissolve the vegetable stock mix in 150ml<span class="text-danger"> [250ml]</span> boiled water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add the quick cook spaghetti to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt, then bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the pasta for 3-4 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the spaghetti, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the spinach has wilted, add the vegetable stock to the pan with the crème fraîche and stir it all together

Cook for 1 min further or until the sauce is starting to thicken

Tip: Add a splash of starchy pasta water if your sauce is looking a little dry</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add the haddock bites with a pinch of salt and cook for 3 min further or until cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the fish is cooked, stir through the drained spaghetti and most of the grated Italian hard cheese (save the rest for garnish!) – this is your creamy haddock Florentine spaghetti</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Set the creamy haddock Florentine spaghetti in the centre of the table, ready to share

Garnish with the remaining grated Italian hard cheese, season with a good grind of black pepper and let everyone dig in

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
