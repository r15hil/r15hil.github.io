<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil a kettle

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Peel and slice the shallot<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Roughly chop the tomato<span class="text-danger">[es]</span>

Slice the green chilli<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> finely

Add the dried yeast to a large bowl with 100ml <span class="text-danger">[200ml] </span>milk and 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar, give it a good mix up and set aside for 5-10 min for the yeast to develop</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based, hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced shallot, chopped tomato, curry powder, ground paprika and ginger & garlic paste and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the chicken stock mix, tomato paste and 150ml <span class="text-danger">[250ml]</span> boiled water to the dish and bring to the boil over a high heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once boiling, top the curry mixture with the duck legs (along with the jelly and fat!) and put the dish in the oven, covered, for 30 min

After 30 min, remove the dish from the oven, and shred the duck meat off the bone, discarding the bone

Once shredded, stir through half the yoghurt (save the rest for garnish!) – this is your duck masala</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add the basmati rice and 250ml<span class="text-danger"> [500ml] </span>cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the yeast has developed, add the pizza base mix, sliced chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and nigella seeds to the bowl with the yeast

Gradually add up to 75ml <span class="text-danger">[150ml] </span>warm water (you may not need all of it), a little at a time, and gently mix with a plastic spatula until a sticky dough ball has formed

Tip the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and knead it for 20 secs with floured hands</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once kneaded, cut the kneaded dough into 2 <span class="text-danger">[4]</span> balls, then roll each dough ball out with a rolling pin into an oval disc – these are your naans

Heat a large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat and cook each naan for 2-3 min on each side or until puffed and golden brown

Once the naans are cooked through, spread lightly with butter and season with a pinch of salt – these are your green chilli & nigella seed naans</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the duck masala over the basmati rice with the green chilli & nigella seed naans

Dollop over the remaining yoghurt

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
