<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>After an initial 30 min, remove the tray from the oven and set aside the pork belly

Add the carrot discs, chopped pepper and your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) to the baking tray and give everything a good mix up

Place your pork belly on top of the vegetables and return the tray to the oven for a further 10-15 min or until the veg is tender and the pork belly is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your roasted pork belly, gamja jorim & spicy roasted veg</p><br><br>

Slice the rested pork belly</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the pork belly slices with the gamja jorim and spicy roasted veg to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
