<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, mix your panko breadcrumbs with your traditional Italian pesto and a drizzle of olive oil – this is your pesto panko

Add your hake fillet[s] to a baking tray (or two!) and coat evenly with the pesto panko

Put the tray[s] in the oven and cook for 12-15 min or until the fish is golden and cooked through – this is your crispy pesto hake

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

Garnish with the reserved basil leaves, and season with a generous grind of black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
