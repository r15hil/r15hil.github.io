<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a full kettle

Peel your potatoes and chop them into large, bite-sized pieces, then add them to a pot with plenty of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender, then drain and return to the pot to steam dry</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat

Once hot, add your beef mince with a generous pinch of salt and pepper then cook for 4-5 min or until browned all over, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the beef is cooking, peel and finely dice your red onion[s]

Drain and rinse your kidney beans

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the beef has browned, add the diced onion to the pan and cook for 3-4 min or until starting to soften and the beef is cooked through (no pink meat!)

Dissolve your beef stock mix in 250ml<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[325ml]</span> [425ml]</span> boiled water with your tomato paste, chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar – this is your chipotle stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the onion has softened, add your chopped garlic, ground smoked paprika, ground cumin and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> flour to the pan and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the chipotle stock and drained kidney beans to the pan and bring to the boil

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 4-5 min or until the sauce has slightly thickened, then remove the pan from the heat – this is your chilli mixture</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Grate the cheddar cheese

Return the drained potatoes to a low heat with 1/3 of your soured cream, half the grated cheese (save the rest for garnish!) and a very generous pinch of salt and pepper

Mash until smooth – this is your mashed potato</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Transfer the chilli mixture to an oven-proof dish, top with the mashed potato and score with a fork

Put the dish in the oven for 25-30 min or until golden brown and bubbling – this is your beef chilli con carne cottage pie

Slice your green chilli[es] finely</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the beef chilli con carne x cottage pie with a dollop of the remaining soured cream

Sprinkle over the remaining grated cheese and sliced green chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
