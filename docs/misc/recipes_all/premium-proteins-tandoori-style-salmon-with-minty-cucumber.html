<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> olive oil over a medium-high heat

Combine your curry powder with half your roasted garlic paste, half your natural yoghurt (you'll use the rest later!) and a pinch of salt in a bowl

Add your salmon fillets and combine until fully coated</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once hot, add the coated salmon fillets, skin-side down to the pan

Cook for 4-5 min on each side or until cooked through – this is your tandoori salmon

Tip: Your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<p>While the salmon is cooking, cut your cucumber in half lengthways and slice roughly

Strip your mint leaves from their stems and chop them finely, discard the stems</p><br><br>
