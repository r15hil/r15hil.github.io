<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a full kettle

Peel your potatoes and chop them into large, bite-sized pieces, then add them to a pot with plenty of boiled water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender, then drain and return to the pot to steam dry</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add your meat free mince (remove the paper if required!) with a generous grind of black pepper then cook for 4-5 min or until beginning to brown all over, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the meat free mince is cooking, peel and finely dice your red onion[s]

Drain and rinse your kidney beans

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add the diced onion to the pan and cook for 3-4 min or until starting to soften

Dissolve your vegetable stock mix in 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[500ml] </span>boiled water with your tomato paste, chipotle paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar – this is your chipotle stock

Once the onion has softened, add the chopped garlic, your ground smoked paprika, ground cumin and 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp] </span><span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>flour to the pan and cook for 1 min or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, add the chipotle stock, drained kidney beans and a pinch of salt to the pan and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 4-5 min or until the sauce has slightly thickened, then remove the pan from the heat – this is your meat free chilli mixture</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Grate your cheddar cheese

Return the drained potatoes to a low heat with a 1/3 of your soured cream, half the grated cheese (save the rest for garnish!), a knob of butter and a very generous pinch of salt and pepper

Mash until smooth – this is your mashed potato</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Transfer the meat free chilli mixture to an oven-proof dish, top with the mashed potato and score with a fork

Put the dish in the oven for 25-30 min or until golden brown and bubbling – this is your meat free chilli con carne x cottage pie

Slice your green chilli[es] finely</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the meat free chilli con carne x cottage pie with a dollop of the remaining soured cream

Sprinkle over the remaining grated cheese and sliced green chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
