<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Rinse your sushi rice in a sieve under cold running water for 30 secs (use your hands to really wash the grains!), then set aside to drain fully

Add the drained rice with 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> cold water and a pinch of salt to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Tip: Don't let the water fully boil as this will make the rice stick to the pot!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Once boiling, reduce the heat to low until very gently bubbling and cook, covered, for 15 min

After 15 min, remove the pot from the heat and keep covered for a further 10 min before serving

Tip: Don't peek! Keep the lid on the whole time to get fluffy and sticky rice!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the rice is cooking, peel and cut half your brown onion[s] into rough bite-sized pieces (save the rest for later!)

Peel and roughly chop your garlic

Peel (scrape the skin off with a teaspoon) and roughly chop your ginger

Add the chopped onion, garlic and ginger to a food processor with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp] </span>cold water and blitz until smooth – this is your ginger & garlic paste</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add your beef strips to a large bowl with the ginger & garlic paste, soy sauce, toasted sesame oil, 2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[4 tsp]</span> sugar and a generous grind of black pepper

Give everything a good mix up and set aside to marinate</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>While the beef is marinating, slice the remaining onion finely

Top, tail peel and chop your carrot[s] into thin batons

Slice your chestnut mushrooms finely</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chopped vegetables with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until they're tender with a slight bite

Once done, transfer them to a plate and set aside for later</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Return the pan to a high heat

Once very hot, add the marinated beef (with the remaining marinade) to the pan and cook for 2-3 min or until the beef is browned all over and slightly pink on the inside

Return the cooked vegetables to the pan and give everything a good mix up – this is your beef bulgogi</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Trim, then slice your spring onion[s] finely

Serve the sticky rice with the beef bulgogi to the side and garnish with the sliced spring onion

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
