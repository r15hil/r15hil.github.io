<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Add your basmati rice and 300ml <span class="text-purple">[390ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[600ml] </span>cold water to a pot with a lid and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 10-12 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the chicken is cooking, wash your spinach then add to a colander and pour boiled water all over it so that it starts to wilt

Rinse the wilted spinach under the cold tap until it's cool

Once cool, squeeze as much water out of the spinach as you can, then chop it roughly</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the chicken is cooked through, add half the sliced spring onions (you'll use the rest later!) to the pan with the chopped garlic, chopped ginger and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and cook for 1-2 min until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>

Pour in the stir-fry sauce, give it a stir and then cook for 2-3 min or until everything is warmed through and coated in the sauce – this is your Chinese-style chicken & sweetcorn stir-fry</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Chinese-style chicken & sweetcorn stir-fry in bowls and garnish with the remaining sliced spring onions
