<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil half a kettle

Drain your tofu and pat it dry with kitchen paper

Cut the tofu into bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped tofu to a large bowl with half of your soy sauce (you'll use the rest later!), a good grind of black pepper and a pinch of sugar

Give everything a good mix up until all the tofu is coated – this is your marinated tofu</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and a pinch of salt, bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a high heat
