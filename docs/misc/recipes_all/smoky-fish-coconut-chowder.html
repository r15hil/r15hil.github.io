<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil half a kettle

Peel and dice your brown onion[s]

Top, tail, peel and dice your carrot[s]

Place your creamed coconut (in its packaging!) in a mug and cover with boiled water (this softens the naturally hard cream)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the diced onion and diced carrot and cook, covered, for 3-5 min or until beginning to soften and brown slightly

Meanwhile, chop your potatoes (skins on) into small cubes</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Reboil a full kettle

Add the chopped potatoes to the pan and cook, covered, for a further 4-6 min

Whilst everything is cooking, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Strip your thyme leaves from their stalks and chop them finely, discard the stalks</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add the chopped garlic, most of the chopped thyme (save some for garnish!) and your bay leaf[ves] to the pan with a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Stir and cook for a further 1 min

Add 400ml <span class="text-purple">[600ml]</span> <span class="text-danger">[800ml]</span> boiled water to the pan, cover, and bring to the boil</p><br><br>
<img src='https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-5-copy-1612978026235-x200.jpg' alt='Step 5 Image'><br><br>
<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add your smoked basa to the pan

Tip: Cooking for 4 or 5? You may need to do this in 2 batches!

Cook, covered, for 6-8 min until your fish is cooked through, turning halfway

Tip: Your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>While the fish is cooking, combine the softened creamed coconut with your cornflour and gradually stir in 100ml <span class="text-purple">[150ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> cold water, mixing well to form a smooth paste – this is your creamed coconut mixture</p><br><br>
<img src='https://production-media.gousto.co.uk/cms/recipe-step-image/step-7-copy-1612978049187-x200.jpg' alt='Step 7 Image'><br><br>
<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the creamed coconut mixture to the pan (this will cause the liquid to thicken as it returns to the boil)

Break up the cooked basa with a wooden spoon as you go

Taste for seasoning, adding more salt and pepper if needed – this is your smoky basa & coconut chowder</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the smoky basa & coconut chowder, discard the bay leaf[ves]

Garnish with the reserved chopped thyme

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
