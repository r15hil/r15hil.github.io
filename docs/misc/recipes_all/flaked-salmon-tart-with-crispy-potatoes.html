<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Chop your potatoes (skins on) into bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a baking tray (or two!) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp – these are your crispy potatoes</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the potatoes are cooking, add your crème fraîche and dried oregano to a bowl with a pinch of salt and a few grinds of black pepper – this is your creamy base mixture</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, dust your work surface with a generous sprinkling of flour

Unwrap your puff pastry and roll it out to approx. 0.5cm thickness with a rolling pin and cut it into 1 rectangle per person

Line a baking tray (or two!) with non-stick baking paper

Add the pastry to the tray[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>and score a 1cm border around the edge of your pastry with a knife

Tip: The pastry border will puff up to give you a nice crust!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Top the creamy base mixture with your salmon flakes and a grind of black pepper

Put the tray[s] in the oven for 15 min or until the pastry is golden and crisp and the edges have puffed up – this is your flaked salmon tart</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>While the tart is cooking, add your balsamic vinegar to a bowl with a generous drizzle of<span class="text-danger"> </span>olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your balsamic dressing</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Wash your salad, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Chop your tomato[es] roughly

Add the chopped tomato and salad to a bowl with the balsamic dressing and gently toss it all together – this is your dressed salad</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the flaked salmon tart with the crispy potatoes and dressed salad to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
