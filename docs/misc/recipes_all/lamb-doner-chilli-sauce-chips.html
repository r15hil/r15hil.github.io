<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Cut your potatoes (skins on) into thin chips

Add the chips to a baking tray (or two!) with a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 20-25 min or until golden and crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the chips are cooking, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Peel and grate half your red onion[s]

Peel and finely slice the remaining red onion and set aside for later</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add your lamb mince to a bowl with your panko breadcrumbs, ground cumin, dried oregano and grated onion

Add 1/2 tsp <span class="text-purple">[3/4 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[1 tsp]</span> salt and half of the chopped garlic (save the rest for later!) and mix thoroughly until fully combined (clean hands is the best way!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Cut two A3 size sheets of non-stick baking paper

Put your lamb mixture between the two sheets and using a rolling pin, roll it out until approx. the thickness of a pound coin, then peel off the top baking sheet and transfer the rolled lamb to a large baking tray (or two!)

Tip: Cooking for 4 or more? Do this in batches!

Add the tray[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>to the oven for 18-20 min or until cooked through and browned (no pink meat!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Wash your lettuce, then pat dry with kitchen paper and finely shred

Slice your tomato[es] into wedges

Combine the remaining chopped garlic (not a fan of raw garlic? Just add a little!) with your mayo, a pinch of salt and a drizzle of olive oil – this is your garlic mayo</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add your tomato ketchup to a separate bowl with your chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and 1 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tbsp]</span> cold water

Give it a good mix up – this is your chilli sauce

Once the chips are almost done, push them to one side, then add your wholemeal pitta[s] to the tray[s] and return to the oven for 3-4 min or until warmed through</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the lamb is cooked, remove it from the oven and pat it dry with kitchen paper

Transfer the cooked lamb to a clean board and slice into long strips – this is your lamb doner meat</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Top the warmed pitta with the shredded lettuce, lamb doner, sliced red onion and tomato wedges

Drizzle over the garlic mayo and chilli sauce (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and serve the chips and remaining garlic mayo to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
