<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add the chopped garlic (not a big garlic fan? Try using less!), chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and coriander to the pestle & mortar with a generous pinch of salt and grind to a paste

Add 3 tbsp <span class="text-purple">[4 1/2 tbsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[6 tbsp]</span> olive oil and the juice of half your lemon[s] and stir it all together – this is your zhoug</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add your pistachios and flaked almonds to a separate baking tray and put in the oven for 2-3 min or until golden and toasted

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don't burn!

Once toasted, roughly chop the pistachios (Careful they may be hot!)

Add half of the chopped pistachios and flaked almonds (save the rest for garnish!) to the cooked bulgur with the juice of the remaining lemon and give it a good mix up – this is your jewelled bulgur</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the roasted sweet potato and crispy chickpeas over the jewelled bulgur

Drizzle over the zhoug and garnish with the remaining nuts

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
