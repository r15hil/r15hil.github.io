<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Boil half a kettle

Peel and finely dice your shallot[s]

Deseed your pepper[s]<span class="text-danger"> </span>(scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips

Add the diced shallot to a small bowl with your white wine vinegar and a pinch of salt and set aside – this is your quick-pickled shallot</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Cut your red chilli[es] in half lengthways, deseed (scrape the seeds out with a teaspoon) and chop finely

Drain and rinse your black beans

Heat a pot with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Once hot, add the chopped garlic, ground cumin and half of your ground smoked paprika (you'll use the rest later!) and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add your tomato paste with 150ml<span class="text-purple"> [195ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[200ml] </span>boiled water, the drained black beans and half of the chopped chilli (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Season with a generous pinch of salt and cook for 5 min or until thickened – these are your spicy black beans</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the beans are cooking, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced pepper to the pan with the remaining ground smoked paprika and a pinch of salt and cook for 3-4 min or until slightly softened

Once slightly softened, transfer the sliced pepper to a plate and reserve the pan</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add your smashed avocado to the quick-pickled shallot with the remaining chopped chilli (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) and a generous pinch of salt and mash with a fork until smooth – this is your homemade guacamole</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Top, tail and peel your mango[es]

Stand the mango[es] upright and very carefully slice the flesh away from the stone[s], then slice the mango flesh finely

Return the reserved pan to a high heat with a drizzle of olive oil and 1 tsp<span class="text-purple"> [1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar

Once the sugar has started to melt, add the mango and cook for 3-4 min, turning once halfway until charred (keep an eye on it to prevent burning!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, add your tortillas to a plate and pop them in the microwave for 1-2 min, or until warmed through

Finely grate your cheddar cheese

Strip your mint leaves from their stems and chop them roughly, discard the stems</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Load up the warmed tortillas with the homemade guacamole, spiced peppers and spicy black beans

Top with grated cheese and charred mango

Sprinkle over the chopped mint

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
