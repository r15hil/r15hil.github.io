<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

This recipe takes around 5-10 min to prep, so get your casserole dish and all your ingredients ready, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Make sure your dish is oven-proof and safe to use on the hob. Don't have one? Start cooking in a large, wide-based pan then transfer to an oven-proof dish and cover tightly with foil</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil half a kettle

Heat a large, wide-based hob-safe oven-proof casserole dish with a matching lid with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Once hot, add your sausages to the dish and cook for 3-4 min or until lightly browned all over</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, chop your leek[s] into large chunks, then wash thoroughly to remove any grit

Chop your potato[es] (skins on) into small bite-sized pieces</p><br><br>

Drain and rinse your butter beans</p><br><br>

Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!</p><br><br>
