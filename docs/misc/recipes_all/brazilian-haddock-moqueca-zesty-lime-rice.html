<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Zest your lime[s] (try to grate lightly with a micro-plane or sharp box grater and avoid grating the white pith, as this is very bitter)

Roll the lime[s] with your hand on a hard surface (to release more juice!) and cut in half

Add your white long grain rice to a pot with a lid with 225ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water and the lime zest and bring to the boil over a high heat</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Squeeze in the juice of half the zested lime and add the squeezed lime half (to intensify the lime flavour!) to the pot

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once done, remove from the heat and set aside (lid on) to steam until serving – this is your zesty lime rice</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the rice is cooking, boil a kettle

Peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and slice into thin strips</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of olive oil over a high heat

Once hot, add the sliced pepper and cook for 3 min or until it begins to soften

Add the chopped garlic and chilli flakes (can't handle the heat? Go easy!)

Reduce the heat to medium and cook for 3 min</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, chop your creamed coconut roughly (if required!)

Dissolve the chopped creamed coconut, vegetable stock mix, chipotle paste (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!), 1 tsp <span class="text-purple">[1 1/2 tsp]</span> <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> sugar, and the juice of the remaining zested lime in 300ml<span class="text-purple"> [450ml]</span><span class="text-danger"> [600ml] </span>boiled water – this is your coconut stock

Strip your coriander leaves from their stalks and chop the stalks finely (save the leaves for garnish!)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add the chopped coriander stalks to the pan and cook for 1 min

Add the coconut stock and cook for 2-3 min or until the sauce has slightly thickened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the sauce has thickened, add your haddock bites (unevenly sized haddock bites? Chop any larger ones into bite-sized pieces!) and cook, covered, for 4-5 min or until the fish is cooked through – this is your Brazilian-style haddock moqueca

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily

Once cooked, remove the squeezed lime half from the cooked rice and discard, then fluff the rice with a fork</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Brazilian-style haddock moqueca with the zesty lime rice to the side

Garnish with the reserved coriander leaves

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
