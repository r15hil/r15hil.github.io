<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add your pitta bread[s] to a toaster for 1-2 min or until warmed through

Add the shredded lettuce, chopped cucumber and half your natural yoghurt to the bowl with the quick-pickled shallot

Mix everything together – this is your yoghurt & cucumber salad

Combine the remaining natural yoghurt with the mustard ketchup in a bowl – this is your yellow sauce</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To build your sandwich, slice open the warmed pitta and fill it with a dollop of yellow sauce, 2 tomato rounds, a outer lettuce leaf and 3 battered halloumi slices – this is your Greek-style battered halloumi sandwich

Serve the yoghurt & cucumber salad and garlic fries to the side with the remaining yellow sauce

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
