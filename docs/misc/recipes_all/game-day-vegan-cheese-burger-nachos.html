<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200°C/ 180°C (fan)/ 395°F/ Gas 6

Stack the tortillas, and slice into triangles

Add the tortilla triangles to a tray (or two!) with a drizzle of olive oil and a generous pinch of salt and pepper

Give everything a good mix up, then spread them out and put the tray in the oven for 4-5 min or until lightly browned and beginning to crisp, then remove from the oven</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the tortilla is in the oven, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the ultimate vegan burger patties to the pan breaking them up with a wooden spoon as you go (as you would mince)

Cook for 3-4 min or until starting to crisp</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic and chop the cornichons roughly

Once the vegan mince is beginning to crisp, add the chopped garlic and cook for 1 min further</p><br><br>

Then repeat one more layer and put the dish in the oven for 3-4 min or until the vegan cheese has melted</p><br><br>

<p>Remove the tortillas from the oven and top with the chopped tomato and shredded little gem

Drizzle over the remaining mustard ketchup mayo and sprinkle over the chopped cornichon
