<h4>Step 1</h4>

Chop the cherry tomatoes in half

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a drizzle of olive oil and 10g <span class="text-danger">[20g]</span> butter over a medium heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion, diced carrot, chopped tomatoes, sliced pepper and half the garlic (save the rest for later!) with a pinch of salt and sugar

Add the star anise and cook for 8-10 min, or until the onion has started to soften and the tomatoes have broken down

Meanwhile, boil a kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the vegetables are cooking, combine the vegetable stock mix and half of the ground turmeric (save the rest for later!) with 350ml <span class="text-danger">[600ml]</span> boiled water – this is your turmeric stock

Once the vegetables have softened, add the tomato paste and cook for 1 min, stirring continuously

Add the turmeric stock and bring to the boil over a high heat, once boiling, reduce the heat to low and cook for 5-6 min or until reduced by half</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, combine the remaining ground turmeric with 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp]</span> boiled water and stir until you have a smooth paste

Add the mayo, remaining chopped garlic and white wine vinegar

Whisk in a drizzle of olive oil with a pinch of black pepper – this is your sunny aioli</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Pat the tilapia fillets dry with kitchen paper

Gently add the tilapia to the pan and cook, covered, for 3-4 min or until the tilapia is cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>While the fish is cooking, chop the parsley finely, including the stalks

Stir most of the chopped parsley (save the rest for garnish!) carefully through the cooked stew – this is your Mediterranean tilapia stew</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the Mediterranean tilapia stew with the hot ciabatta to the side

Garnish with the remaining chopped parsley and drizzle over the sunny aioli

Tip: Don't forget to remove the star anise!

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
