<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Get all your ingredients and equipment ready

Skim through these steps, then wash your fruit and veg

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 mins)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Peel and finely slice your red onion[s]

Trim, then chop your green beans in half</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a generous drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced onion and halved beans and cook for 3-4 min or until slightly softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, slice your halloumi into thin strips (save the halloumi liquid from the packet for later!)

Heat a separate large, dry, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a high heat

Once hot, add the sliced halloumi to the pan and cook for 2-3 min on each side or until golden and crisp</p><br><br>

Squeeze your pouch[es] of cooked brown long grain rice to separate the grains</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the onion and beans are slightly softened, add your ras el hanout and cook for 30 secs or until fragrant</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once fragrant, add the spinach to the pan with your chopped dates, cooked brown long grain rice, halloumi liquid and a small splash of cold water

Stir it altogether and cook, covered, for 3-4 min or until warmed through and the spinach has wilted â€“ this is your fruity spinach pilaf</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the fruity spinach pilaf topped with the halloumi slices

Drizzle your natural yoghurt over the top and season with a pinch of pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
