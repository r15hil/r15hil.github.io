<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Boil half a kettle

Slice your potatoes (skins on) into discs and add them to a baking tray (or two!) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt

Give everything a good mix up and put the tray[s] in the oven for 15-20 min or until beginning to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>While the potatoes are cooking, peel and finely chop your red onion[s]

Top, tail, peel and dice your carrot[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the chopped onion and carrot with a pinch of salt and cook for 4-5 min or until softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) your garlic

Dissolve your beef stock mix in 250ml <span class="text-purple">[325ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[425ml]</span> boiled water

Stir in your harissa paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!), tomato paste and chopped dates – this is your spicy stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the onion and carrot have softened, increase the heat to high and add your lamb mince to the pan with your ground cumin and chopped garlic

Cook for 4-5 min or until browned, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as you go

Add the spicy stock, bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 3-4 min further or until thickened to a bolognese-like consistency and the lamb is cooked through (no pink meat!) – this is your spicy lamb mixture</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Transfer the spicy lamb mixture to an oven-proof dish

Carefully top with the softened potato discs (beware, they will be hot!)

Put the dish in the oven for 15-20 min or until everything is bubbling and the potatoes are golden and cooked through – this is your harissa lamb hotpot</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Use this time to clear up, set the table, have a cup of tea or simply chill!

Once the hotpot has been cooking for 10 min, reboil half a kettle

Add your green beans to a pot over a medium-high heat and cover them with boiled water

Bring to the boil over a high heat and cook for 3-4 min or until tender with a bite</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Strip your mint leaves from their stalks and chop them finely, discard the stalks

Once the beans are tender, drain and return them to the pot

Add a knob of butter and the chopped mint and stir it all together until melted – these are your minty beans</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the harissa lamb hotpot with the minty beans to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
