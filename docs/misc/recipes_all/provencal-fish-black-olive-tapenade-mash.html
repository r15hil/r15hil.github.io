<p><strong>Description:</strong> 'Piquant', or pleasantly sharp, are the only words for this baked fish's bold tapenade and 'piperade' tomato sauce. Savoury, simple and distinctly South of France, this plate wouldn't be complete without a forkful of creamy, buttery mash with every bite.

<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7, then boil a full kettle

Deseed your pepper[s] (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into bite-sized chunks

Peel and chop (or grate) your garlic</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a generous drizzle of olive oil over a medium heat

Once hot, add the diced onion with a generous pinch of salt and cook for 4 min or until soft</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel your potatoes and chop them into large, bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped potatoes to a pot with plenty of boiled water and a generous pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 12-15 min or until fork-tender

Once done, drain and return to the pot to steam dry</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the potatoes are cooking, roughly chop your black olives

When the onion has softened, add the chopped pepper, chopped tomatoes and half of the chopped garlic (you'll use the rest later!) and cook for 3-4 min

Add your tomato paste and a pinch of sugar, salt and pepper with 200ml <span class="text-purple">[300ml] </span><span class="text-danger">[400ml]</span> boiled water to the pan and cook, covered, for 15 min or until reduced to a stew-like consistency – this is your Provençal-style sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Grind the chopped black olives, remaining chopped garlic and a pinch of salt in a pestle & mortar to form a smooth paste (alternatively, use a food processor)

Add a generous drizzle of olive oil and give it a good mix up – this is your black olive tapenade</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Add your basa fillet[s] to a tin foil-lined tray

Divide and spread the black olive tapenade over the basa fillet[s]

Put the tray in the oven for 12-15 min or until the basa is cooked through – this is your tapenade baked basa

Tip: Your fish is cooked when it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Return the drained potatoes to a low heat and add a splash of olive oil and a knob of butter

Season with salt and pepper and mash until smooth</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the tapenade baked basa with the mash and Provençal-style sauce to the side

Add a generous grind of black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
