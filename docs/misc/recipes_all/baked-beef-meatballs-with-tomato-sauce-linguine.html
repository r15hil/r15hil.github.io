<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Add the beef mince, panko breadcrumbs and a generous pinch of salt and pepper to a bowl

<h4>Step 3</h4>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>While the onion is softening, dissolve the beef stock mix, tomato paste and a pinch of sugar in 150ml <span class="text-danger">[200ml]</span> boiled water

Add the dried oregano, balsamic vinegar and chopped tomatoes and give everything a good mix up – this is your tomato sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the onion has softened, add the tomato sauce to the dish and cook for 25-30 min or until the meatballs are cooked through (no pink meat!) and the sauce has thickened to a ragù-like consistency</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, reboil a kettle

Once the meatballs have been cooking for 10-15 min, add the linguine to a pot of boiled water with a large pinch of salt and bring to the boil over a high heat

Cook the linguine for 8-10 min or until cooked with a slight bite

Once done, drain the linguine</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Wash the spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Once the meatballs are cooked, remove the dish from the oven and top with the spinach

Return the dish to the oven and cook for 1-2 min further or until the spinach has started to wilt

Mix it all together – these are your baked beef meatballs with tomato sauce</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the baked beef meatballs with tomato sauce over the drained linguine

Grate the cheddar cheese over the top and season with a generous grind of black pepper

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
