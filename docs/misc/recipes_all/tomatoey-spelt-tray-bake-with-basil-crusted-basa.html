<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add the chopped yellow pepper, crushed garlic and spelt to an oven-proof dish

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) the remaining garlic

Chop the basil finely, including the stalks

Grind the chopped basil and chopped garlic with a pinch of salt in a pestle & mortar to form a paste

Add 2 tbsp <span class="text-danger">[4 tbsp]</span> olive oil and mix well – this is your basil oil

Tip: If you don't have a pestle and mortar, chop everything very finely and mix with the oil</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>After the tomatoey spelt tray bake has had 30 min, remove the dish from the oven and discard the tin foil

Pat the basa fillets dry with kitchen paper, lay them on top of the spelt and top them with the basil breadcrumbs

Return the dish to the oven for 12-15 min or until the fish is cooked through and the breadcrumbs are golden

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>
