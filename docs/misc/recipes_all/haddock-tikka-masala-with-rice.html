<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you begin...

Note: Equipment and pan sizes vary. Make sure you cook food thoroughly (even if it takes you a little longer than 10 min)</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Now, let's get started!

Boil half a kettle

Chop the tomatoes into large bite-sized pieces</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick with a matching lid) with a generous drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the chopped tomatoes to the pan with a generous pinch of salt and cook for 2 min until the tomato has started to soften

Meanwhile, pat the haddock bites dry with kitchen paper

Tip: Unevenly sized haddock bites? Chop any larger ones into bite-sized pieces!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Add 100ml<span class="text-danger"> [150ml]</span> boiled water and the vegetable stock mix to the pan, give everything a good mix up then bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and top the sauce with the haddock bites

Cook, covered, for 4-5 min further or until the fish is cooked through

Tip: Your fish is cooked once it turns opaque and flakes easily</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Squeeze the pouch<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> of steamed white basmati rice to separate the grains

Tear the top corner of the pouch<span class="text-danger">[es]</span> (just a little!) and microwave for 2 min or until piping hot

Tip: If you're cooking two pouches, pop them in together but increase the microwave cook time accordingly</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the haddock bites are cooked through, remove the pan from the heat and stir through the clotted cream â€“ this is your haddock tikka masala</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the haddock tikka masala with the basmati rice to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
