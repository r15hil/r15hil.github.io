<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Rinse the brown rice, add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 20-25 min or until tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain into a sieve and set aside, reserving the pot for later</p><br><br>

Once hot, add the seasoned chicken and cook for 2-3 min or until starting to brown slightly, then reduce the heat to low and cook, covered, for 10 min or until the chicken is nearly cooked through</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Remove the lid from the pan and add the soy and honey sauce

Increase the heat to medium and cook for a further 2-4 min or until the chicken is cooked through (no pink meat!) and a sticky sauce has formed, then remove from the heat – this is your sticky chicken</p><br><br>

Rinse the baby kale

Add the drained rice with the washed kale and cook for 1 min or until the kale is mixed through and beginning to wilt

Remove the pot from the heat and season with a pinch of salt – this is your brown rice & kale</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the sticky chicken over the brown rice & kale

Sprinkle over the sesame seeds

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
