<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add your chopped potatoes to one side of a large baking paper, lined baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil, your dried sage and a generous pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up

Tip: Cooking for 3 or more? Use 2 trays!

Add your portobello mushroom[s] to the other side of the tray[s] and top with a drizzle of olive oil and a generous pinch of salt</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, combine your tomato ketchup with your cranberry sauce in a small bowl – this is your cranberry ketchup

Boil a full kettle</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the potatoes and mushroom[s] are tender and golden, remove the tray[s] from the oven

Carefully move the potatoes and mushroom[s] to one side of the tray[s]

Crack your egg[s] onto the tray[s]

Tip: Give your egg a little shake before you crack for a perfectly centred yolk!

Add your brioche bun[s] on top of the potatoes</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Return the tray[s] to the oven for 3-5 min or until the egg is done to your liking and the brioche is warmed through</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>While everything is in the oven, wash your spinach then add to a colander and pour boiled water all over it so that it starts to wilt

Drain the spinach and squeeze any excess water out with the back of a spoon (this will stop your brioche bun[s] from going soggy!)</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>To build your bun, top each warmed brioche base with some wilted spinach, a roasted mushroom and an egg

Add a drizzle of cranberry ketchup and top with a warmed brioche lid – this is your one tray portobello & egg brunch bun with cranberry ketchup

Serve with the sage potatoes to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
