<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Heat a pot with a matching lid with a knob of butter over a medium heat

Once melted, add the black mustard seeds and cook for 30 secs, stirring continuously, until fragrant

Rinse the white long grain rice until the water runs clear, then add it to the pot with a pinch of salt and stir to fully coat the grains</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add 225ml <span class="text-danger">[450ml]</span> cold water to the pot and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to very low and cook, covered, for 12-15 min or until all the water has absorbed and the rice is cooked

Once cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Peel and finely slice the red onion<span class="text-danger">[s]</span>

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick), with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the sliced red onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 3 min or until starting to soften</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the onion has started to soften, add the chopped garlic and smoked paprika and cook for 2 min further until fragrant

Once fragrant, roughly tear all of the mushrooms into the pan and cook for 4 min until they are starting to caramelise

Tip: Try not to move the mushrooms around too much as this will stop them from caramelising!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, chop the parsley and chives finely, including the stalks

Bash the walnuts in their bag with a rolling pin until crushed into small pieces</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the mushrooms have started to brown and caramelise, add the tamari soy sauce and Henderson's Relish and cook for 2 min further

Reduce the heat to low and stir through the crème fraîche and a generous grind of black pepper – this is your 3-mushroom stroganoff

Tip: The water from the mushrooms should make it saucy but if yours is looking a little dry, add a splash of water!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the rice is cooked, add the crushed walnuts and half of the chopped parsley and chives (save the rest for garnish!) and gently mix it all together – this is your walnut rice</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the 3-mushroom stroganoff over the walnut rice

Sprinkle over the remaining chopped parsley and chives

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
