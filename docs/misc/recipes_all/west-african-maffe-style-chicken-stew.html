<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Rinse your brown rice, add it to a pot with plenty of cold water and bring to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 15-20 min or until it's tender with a slight bite

Once cooked, drain, return it to the pot and keep covered until serving</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the onion has softened, add the diced chicken thigh to the pan and cook for an initial 5 min

Combine your chicken stock mix and tomato paste with 300ml<span class="text-danger"> <span class="text-purple">[450ml] </span>[600ml]</span> boiled water – this is your tomato stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Once the chicken is cooked through, add the peanut butter and half the ground almonds<span class="text-danger"> </span>(save the rest for later!)<span class="text-danger"> </span>to the pan and stir thoroughly for 1 min or until the sauce has thickened

Remove from the heat and stir through half the chopped coriander (save the rest for garnish!) – this is your maffe-style chicken stew</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the maffe-style chicken stew over the brown rice

Garnish with the remaining ground almonds and remaining chopped coriander
