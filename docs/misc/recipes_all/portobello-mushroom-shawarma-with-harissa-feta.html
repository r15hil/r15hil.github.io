<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat

Drizzle olive oil over both sides of the portobello mushrooms and add them to the pan

Tip: Cooking for 4? You may need to do this in batches!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Cover the mushrooms with a smaller, heavy-based pan and cook for 2-3 min on each side or until beginning to soften

Once beginning to soften, turn the mushrooms so they are stem-side up and add a heavy weight (e.g. several cans) to the pan on top

Cook for 4-5 min further or until most of the moisture has been released

Once done, remove the pan from the heat and set aside</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>While the mushrooms are cooking, top, tail, and chop the carrots in half lengthways, then into batons

Add the carrot batons to a baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil, half the harissa paste (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and a pinch of sugar, salt and pepper

Give everything a mix up and put the tray in the oven for 15-20 min or until tender and beginning to crisp – these are your harissa roasted carrots</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Crumble the feta into a small bowl and add the remaining harissa paste (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!)

Combine the ground cumin, cinnamon, paprika and dried oregano on a small plate with a pinch of salt and pepper – this is your shawarma seasoning</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Peel lengths off the cucumber until you end up with a pile of cucumber 'ribbons'

Peel and finely chop the garlic

Combine the natural yoghurt with the chopped garlic (not a fan of raw garlic? Try using less!) and a pinch of salt – this is your garlic yoghurt</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Transfer the pressed mushrooms to a chopping board and reserve the pan

Rub the shawarma seasoning into both sides of the mushrooms (be careful – they may still be hot!)

Return the reserved pan to a medium heat with a drizzle of olive oil

Cook the seasoned mushrooms for 3-4 min or until beginning to blacken – these are your shawarma mushrooms</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the naans to the oven for 2-3 min or until hot

Slice the shawarma mushrooms thinly using a sharp knife

Wash the rocket, then pat it dry with kitchen paper</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Spread the garlic yoghurt over the warmed naan and pile on the sliced shawarma mushrooms, cucumber ribbons, harissa feta and some rocket , then use a skewer to hold everything together

Serve the remaining rocket and the harissa roasted carrots to the side

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
