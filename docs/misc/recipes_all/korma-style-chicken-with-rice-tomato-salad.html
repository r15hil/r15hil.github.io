Add the chopped garlic, the juice of half your<span class="text-danger"> </span>lemon[s], a drizzle of vegetable oil and a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up – this is your curry marinade

Tip: Watch them like a hawk to make sure they don’t burn!

Add the toasted almonds to the drained brown rice and give everything a good mix up – this is your almond rice</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the curried chicken over the almond rice with the chunky salad and remaining natural yoghurt to the side
