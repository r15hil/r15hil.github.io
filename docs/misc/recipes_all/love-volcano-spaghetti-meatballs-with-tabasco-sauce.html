<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven to 220°C/ 200°C (fan)/ gas 7 and boil a full kettle

Peel and finely dice 1/2 <span class="text-danger">[1]</span> brown onion and grate the remaining onion

Peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic

Drain the mozzarella, then pat and squeeze as much liquid out as you can with kitchen paper and tear into small, bite-sized pieces</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Add the beef mince to a large bowl with the grated onion, panko breadcrumbs, half the garlic, half the beef stock mix (you'll use the rest later!), 1 tsp <span class="text-danger">[2 tsp] </span>cold water and a generous pinch of salt and pepper and give everything a good mix up (clean hands is the best way) – this is your meatball mixture

Divide the meatball mixture into 2 <span class="text-danger">[4]</span> balls, then flatten into circles (big enough to enclose the mozzarella)

Split the torn mozzarella equally between each meatball</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Wrap the meatball mix around the filling to form 2 <span class="text-danger">[4] </span>meatballs and seal them tightly on all sides so that there aren't any gaps – these are your stuffed meatballs

Add the stuffed meatballs to a baking paper-lined oven-proof dish and drizzle with a little olive oil

Put the dish in the oven for 25-30 min or until browned, cooked through and the top of the meatball has cracked open – these are your ‘love volcano’ meatballs</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Once the meatballs are in the oven, heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat

Once hot, add the diced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 6-7 min or until softened and slightly caramelised

Dissolve the remaining beef stock mix and half the balsamic vinegar (save the rest for garnish!) in 200ml <span class="text-danger">[350ml] </span>boiled water – this is your balsamic stock</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Once the onion has slightly caramelised, add the tomato paste and remaining garlic to the pan and cook for 1 min or until fragrant

Once fragrant, add the chopped tomatoes and balsamic stock with a pinch of salt and a very generous grind of black pepper, then stir it all together and bring to a boil over a high heat

Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium and cook for 12-14 min or until thickened, stirring occasionally – this is your rich tomato sauce</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>While the sauce is cooking, bring a pot of boiled water with a pinch of salt to the boil over a high heat

Once boiling, add the spaghetti and cook for 7-8 min or until almost cooked

Tip: Your pasta will finish cooking in the sauce!

Once done, drain the spaghetti, reserving a cup of the starchy pasta water</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Add the cooked spaghetti, a splash of starchy pasta water and any meatball cooking juices to the sauce

Stir it all together and cook for a final 1-2 min or until the sauce has thickened and the spaghetti is nicely coated

Meanwhile, wash the rocket and pat dry with kitchen paper

Stir 1/3 of the TABASCO® Sauce<span class="text-danger"> </span>(can't handle the heat? Go easy!) through the spaghetti<span class="text-danger"> </span>– this is your spicy tomato spaghetti</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the spicy tomato spaghetti topped with a ‘love volcano’ meatball

Drizzle the remaining TABASCO® Sauce (not a fan of spice? Just add a little!) over the top of the meatballs and season with a grind of pepper

Garnish with the rocket drizzled with the remaining balsamic vinegar and a little olive oil

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
