<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Before you start cooking, take your chicken out of the fridge, open the packet and let it air

Chop your chicken breast portion[s] into bite-sized pieces

Add the chopped chicken to a bowl with your curry powder, ground turmeric, cayenne pepper (can't handle the heat? Go easy!) and a generous pinch of salt then give everything a good mix up so that the chicken is fully coated in the spices – this is your coated chicken</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Peel and finely slice your red onion[s]

Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of vegetable oil over a medium-low heat

Once hot, add 3/4 of the sliced onion (save the rest for later!) with a pinch of salt and cook for 10-12 min or until softened</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 3</h4>

Strip your mint leaves from their stalks and chop them finely, discard the stalks</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Add the chopped coriander and mint to a pestle & mortar with a small squeeze<span class="text-danger"> </span>of lemon juice and a pinch of salt

Grind to a fine paste, then add your mayo and a drizzle of olive oil – this is your mint chutney

Tip: If you don't have a pestle and mortar, chop everything very finely!</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Dice your tomato[es]

Add the diced tomato to a bowl with your nigella seeds, remaining sliced onion and a drizzle of olive oil

Season with a pinch of salt and give everything a good mix up – this is your tomato salad</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Once the onion has softened, increase the heat to high

Add the coated chicken to the pan and cook for 10-12 min or until cooked through (no pink meat!)

Squeeze in the juice of the remaining lemon and mix to combine – this is your spiced chicken

While the chicken is cooking, add your tortillas to a plate and pop in the microwave for 20 secs on high or until warmed through</p><br><br>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Heat a separate large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium-high heat

Wash your spinach, then pat it dry with kitchen paper

Once hot, remove the pan from the heat, then add the spinach

Return the pan to the heat, stir for 1 min or until the spinach is beginning to wilt very slightly, then remove from the heat</p><br><br>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Serve the warmed tortillas topped with the wilted spinach, spiced chicken and tomato salad

Drizzle over the mint chutney

Enjoy!</p><br><br>
