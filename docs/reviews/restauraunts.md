## [Roti King Battersea](https://www.rotiking.com/)

If you're on the hunt for a flavour-packed Malaysian feast, look no further than Roti King Battersea. My girlfriend and I decided to try out a few dishes and let me tell you, we were not disappointed.

First up, the mutton roti canai – a true crowd-pleaser. The meat was cooked to absolute perfection, and the spices in the thick sauce blended together in a flavour explosion that matched beautifully with the meaty mutton. It was hands down my favourite dish of the night, and if we weren't as full as we were, we would've got another.

The chicken canai came in at a close second, with tender, juicy chicken and plenty of flavour to satisfy taste buds. While the sauce was thinner than the mutton roti canai, it still had enough oomph to make me think about it once I had left. 

And let's not forget the roti – it was a deliciously soft and warm hug with layers that we kept tearing apart to soak up all that yummy sauce.

Finally, we tried the nasi lemak rice dish. While it didn't quite live up to the high bar set by the roti canai, it was still a decent dish. The spiced fried chicken was good, but not quite as flavourful as we hoped it would be. The compartmentalized presentation didn't quite do it for us, but the rice, anchovies and egg were a tasty trio.

All in all, it was a very flavourful meal that left us feeling satisfied and content. If we find ourselves in the area again, we would definitely make a beeline for Roti King Battersea. The food is definitely worth the visit and the ambiance is a fun and lively experience that adds to the enjoyment. If you're in the area and looking for a tasty meal, be sure to stop by Roti King Battersea!
